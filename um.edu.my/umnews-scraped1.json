    "body": "The Jeans for Genes Malaysia (J4GM) 2016 campaign which was co-organised by the Faculty of Medicine and the Genetics Medicine Unit, at the University of Malaya Medical Centre was not only a resounding success, but the innovative double helix constructed from jeans donated by the public also made it to the Malaysia Guiness Book of Records.The organisers of the campaign constructed a 531m-long DNA double helix structure by using over 1,000 pairs of jeans in conjuction with the J4GM campaign campaign aimed at raising funds for children who suffer from genetically linked diseases.The purpose of the campaign was also to raise public awareness about genetic disorders and to raise much needed funds which will be used to provide these children with medical care. It is estimated that every year in Malaysia, some 20,000 children are born with congenital malformations which are often physically expressed over a wide range of debilitating symptoms.The jeans which were sourced from donations from the general public will be sold off as part of the organization's fundraising efforts at a later date. J4GM director, Dr Azlina Ahmad Annuar was touched by the support they received for the event.\u201cA lot of people supported the campaign. Some of them showed up on the day of the event bringing even more jeans.\u201cWe wanted to do something different where it will be more meaningful and significant for the public to help the organisation raise funds,\u201d she said.She added that getting donations will be made easier with the sale of the jeans, rather than asking people for money.\u201cDuring the campaign, the visitors also interacted with some of the people who suffered from genetic disorders and it gave them the opportunity to learn about genetic disorders,\u201d she said.The event was a mix of educational talks about genetic disorders and genetic counselling. It also provided an opportunity for adults and children to learn more about DNA through engaging activities like extracting their own DNA, creating DNA artwork and playing DNA-related games. A popular local artiste, Hanie Soraya, who is also a medical student herself also made a special appearance during the event.J4G was organized in collaboration with relevant NGOs such as the Malaysian Rare Disorders Society, the National Ichtyosis Society, the Apert Syndrome Society, Epidermolysis Bullosa society (DEBRA Malaysia) with support from corporate sponsors among which were Pfizer, NanolifeQuest, Themed Resorts, Attractions and Hotels (TARH) \u2013 Kidzania and Kindness Malaysia.By Harris Rajahdin"

This position placed UM as Top 20 amongst Emerging Economies universities, and also the best performing university in Malaysia.The THE-EEUR system (in its sixth year) includes a special group of 300 plus universities that spread across 40 over countries classified by FTSE* as in advanced emerging, secondary emerging or frontier economies. \u00a0Malaysia is classified as advanced emerging by the FTSE classification.Certainly this ranking provides a good gauge on UM\u2019s core standing performance in teaching, research, knowledge transfer and international outlook. THE-EEUR ranking methodology uses the same 13 performance indicators as THE World University Rankings (THE-WUR) with five core indicators: Teaching (30%), Research (30%), Citations (20%), International Outlook (10%) and Industry Income (10%). Compared to the THE-WUR methodology, the last three indicators, that is, Citations, International Outlook and Industry Income had been recalibrated for its weightings.UM continues to focus on strengthening its fundamentals through the many phases of its Strategic Plan. Through the UM Eco-Campus Blueprint (UMECB), UM has expanded its research focus on environment and sustainability matters linked to the United Nations Sustainability Goals (SDGs). Many initiatives outlined in the UMECB is promulgating UM\u2019s research orientation towards closer partnership in various industries and community.UM\u2019s Vice-Chancellor, Datuk Ir.

He also mentioned that UM aims to improve its linkages and collaboration with strategic industries and international partnerships in order to better prepare UM graduates to handle new technologies as the economy moves towards Industrial Revolution (IR) 4.0. The challenge is how universities can handle these fast evolving smart technologies in this IR 4.0 era.Datuk Ir. (Dr.) Abdul Rahim Hj. Hashim wishes to thank the university community - staff and students for their commitment and contributions towards the achievement of the University\u2019s performance.

    "body": "TheTimes Higher Education (THE)released the World University Rankings on 26 September 2018, and this is UM\u2019s second time being ranked worldwide by THE since 2017. The release showed that the University of Malaya (UM) has improved in its ranking from the position of 351\u2013400 last year to 301\u2013350 this year out of 1258 institutions worldwide. This is a great achievement for the University as it is an indication of UM\u2019s gradual improvement in the ranking system. \u00a0This year also sees UM as the top University amongst 11 Malaysian universities that were being ranked by THE.The improvement in rankings is an affirmation of the university\u2019s strategic plan as UM continue to strive to be an internationally renowned institution of higher learning in research, innovation, publication and teaching. UM\u2019s rise in rankings is due to past years\u2019 initiatives taken over several years to improve the performance of the university. \u00a0THE rankings employ 13 calibrated performance indicators to reflect a university\u2019s strengths in five areas that represent the core missions of research intensive universities: Teaching, Research, Citations, International Outlook and Industry Income. \u00a0In this latest ranking, UM has performed best in International Outlook where we were ranked in the first decile, and our weakest pillar was in Citations, where we were ranked in the fourth decile.UM\u2019s Vice-Chancellor, Datuk Ir. (Dr.) Abdul Rahim Hj. Hashim is delighted with the results. \u00a0He says, \u201cWe are delighted that UM has once again been recognised amongst the world\u2019s leading universities and Malaysia\u2019s top University\u201d. He reiterated that UM is not chasing after rankings, but its participation in the ranking systems is indeed to benchmark UM against other Institutions of Higher Learning, in order to gauge the present state and status of the university and to plan for further strategic improvement.The Vice-Chancellor also mentioned that over the years UM has improved in building on its fundamentals, but it is utmost pertinent for UM to improve in strategic thrust areas, namely, for financial sustainability, increase industry income, and wealth creation. \u00a0This is because the transformative challenges that universities will face in the coming years are in the area of Industrial Revolution 4.0. Technology driven innovation industries will demand students that are trained in critical tech-sectors like fintech, blockchains, smartapps, smart contracts and other robotech skills. In order to spur UM to scale greater heights in IR 4.0, the University requires new funds to harness and train such skills. Without a well-endowed fund, these challenges will be harder for the University to achieve.The Vice-Chancellor would like to thank the University community - staff and students for their commitments and contributions towards the achievement of the University\u2019s performance. \u00a0He also would like to thank the Ministry of Education (MOE) and hope that MOE will continue to provide strong support to UM for UM to fulfill its mission and in the process, produce talented graduates that will become future leaders and technopreneurs for a new Malaysia."

Established in 1994 with the participation of all members under JACTIM, the JACTIM Foundation starting its donation and support activities to various academic institutions in Malaysia since 1996. This is for the purpose of strengthening the friendship goodwill relationship through promotion of mutual understanding between Malaysia and Japan.The Foundation at its annual general meeting this year has approved another budget of RM60,000 for the year 2018 as financial support to the Japan Studies Programme at the Department of East Asian Studies, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, University of Malaya (UM). This support is to assist the further development of Japan Studies Programme in UM as the only undergraduate program which offers specialization in the field of Japan studies in Malaysia.Breakdown of the RM60,000 grant are as follows:A total of RM14,000 scholarships for 14 students majoring Japan Studies who already completed first year of studies;A total of RM5,000 awards for 2 excellent students majoring Japan Studies who already completed their second year of studies;RM10,000 to be distributed as research grant for postgraduate students who specializing in Japan Studies;RM5,000 to conduct thesis writing workshops for postgraduate students at the Department of East Asian Studies;RM10,000 for the purchase of books and journals related to Japan Studies;RM10,000 to publish and launch a book on Japan; andRM6,000 to organise activities to promote Japan as well as the Japan Studies Programme.These make the sum of grant that has been contributed by the JACTIM Foundation amounted to RM1,329,200 so far.The Japan Studies Programme at UM was established in 1993 with the funding by the Japanese Official Development Assistance amounting to 50 million yen. Having been offered for 25 years, the relatively higher number of students is a testament to the popularity of this programme in Malaysia. A number of graduates of the program have since been involved with a number of major Malaysian, Japanese and other multinational firms. With the skills set they acquire, some graduates are able to mould themselves into successful entrepreneurs breaking into the Japanese market. A number of graduates have also been absorbed into teaching positions in various higher education institutions which include UM, UKM, UMS, UPSI, UMK, UiTM, Keio University, KUIS and UTAR, to name a few.It is hoped that through this kind of support, it will deepen the understanding of Japan among the students, thus will bring long term benefits for the relationship of both countries."

Saya tidak berapa pandai bergaul dengan pelajar lain sebenarnya, maklumlah kerana kita ni anak petani,\u201d katanya memulakan sesi perbualan kami tempoh hari, sejurus penganugerahan Tokoh Maal Hijrah 1444H Peringkat Wilayah Persekutuan.Mengetahui kepetahannya berkata-kata dan melontarkan hujah, dan pada masa yang sama mengemudi Persatuan Mahasiswa Islam Universiti Malaya (PMIUM) dan Majlis Perwakilan Mahasiswa Universiti Malaya (MPPUM) di zaman mudanya dahulu, pendedahan ini sama sekali tidak kami percayai.Menyedari kami tersenyum sinis sesama sendiri, Dato\u2019 Prof. Dr. Yakub@Zulkifli Mohd Yusoff pantas menyambung, \u201cNamun, tidak dinafikan penghijrahan secara peribadi juga berlaku kepada semua orang, termasuklah saya sendiri. Untuk saya, ada empat hijrah peribadi yang saya kira signifikan dalam pembentukan seorang Zulkifli yang anda lihat pada hari ini,\u201d katanya sambil tersenyum.Meneruskan penerangannya, anak kelahiran Kota Bharu, Kelantan ini berkongsi mengenai hijrah pertamanya ketika mula-mula bergelar pensyarah dahulu, di mana beliau berjaya memperkenalkan enviromen Islamik di dalam urusan audit dalaman universiti, ketika menjadi sebahagian daripada Unit Pengurusan dan Jaminan Kualiti (QAMU).\u201cHijrah kedua saya berlaku semasa saya bertugas sebagai Pengarah Akademi Pengajian Islam UM (APIUM), di mana saya melaksanakan inisiatif pengantarabangsaan secara agresif, berkat galakan dari Naib Canselor ketika itu, Tan Sri Dr. Ghauth Jasmon. Pelbagai kolaborasi ini telah meningkatkan jumlah penerbitan makalah di dalam jurnal antarabangsa berwasit, dan hasilnya berjaya meletakkan APIUM di mata dunia,\u201d kata alumni jurusan Usuluddin ini dengan bangga.Sambil matanya melirik ke arah tafsir al-Qur\u2019an yang tersusun rapi di rak buku bersebelahan mejanya, Prof. Zulkifli menambah: \u201cHijrah ketiga dan keempat peribadi saya adalah berkaitan dengan penyelidikan saya mengenai kitab suci al-Qur\u2019an ini sendiri. Melalui Pusat Penyelidikan al-Qur\u2019an (CQR), saya berhasil menarik minat pelajar antarabangsa untuk mula datang dan menyambung pengajian di APIUM.Manakala melalui Institut Pengajian Al-Qur\u2019an (IPAQ) yang saya asaskan pula, saya mula mendekati masyarakat hingga ke pedalaman Sabah dalam jihad saya membasmi buta huruf Qur\u2019an. Melalui kaedah yang dibangunkan, seorang yang langsung tidak mengenali huruf al-Qur\u2019an, akan mampu membaca al-Qur'an dalam masa 28 jam kursus sahaja,\u201d terangnya lagi.Menariknya, antara usaha kerjasama CQR adalah bersama penyelidik Fakulti Sains Komputer dan Teknologi Maklumat (FSKTM) UM dan Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia (USIM) yang membangunkan kaedah pengajaran al-Qur\u2019an untuk anak-anak autistik dan pekak.\u201cRasanya sudah cukup maklumat untuk buat buku biografi saya ni,\u201d kata Prof. Zulkifli, tersenyum memandang kami.\u201cPastikan diletakkan mutiara kata Arab ini di mukasurat pertama ya: \u2018Setiap insan yang mempunyai penglihatan mampu melihat cahaya, namun tanpa cahaya, tiada insan yang dapat melihat walaupun mempunyai penglihatan\u2019,\u201d kata tokoh agamawan ini.\u201cJom kita minum fresh orange; saya belanja. Haus pula saya ditemuramah sambil pura-pura membaca buku tafsir begini,\u201d katanya bersahaja.Menoleh ke arah Latimin Keman, jurufoto kami yang akan pencen pada tahun hadapan, dia bertanya:\u201cOh ya, kamu sudah khatam Qur\u2019an berapa kali, ya?\u201d\u2026\u2026Interview by Mohd.

The Centre for Leadership and Professional Development or UM LEAD will draw insights from various disciplines to develop leaders not only on technical knowledge but also focuses on values.UM LEAD, an initiative by the university, could impact the way leadership is viewed in the\u00a0corporate, public sectors and civil societies. UM LEAD was set up to develop responsible and accountable leaders. Through its flagship programme, the Purposeful and Principled Leadership (PPL) course, it offers an innovative environment for organisations to work on their human capital challenges by drawing from the latest thought leadership and using analytical tools in an interactive format. \u201cOur approach uses the Malaysian cultural and historical heritage as a competitive advantage with understanding of its legal environment and business culture. We prepare our participants to be better leaders.\u201d said Datuk Dr. Anis Yusal Yusoff, Director of UM LEAD. Together with the focus on values driven governance, UM LEAD offers a rare learning experience to participants and partners.UM LEAD\u2019s PPL course offers a small group of participants to openly interact with experts with a high focus on Malaysian and regional issues.

    "body": "University of Malaya (UM) and Cancer Research Malaysia have won a research grant of GBP 146,920 from the UK Medical Research Council to collaborate with Professor Sarah Barman at Kingston University to develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled mobile phone application for early detection of oral cancer.Oral cancer is the most common cancer and the most common cause of cancer deaths in men in India, and it is among the top 5 most common cancers in Asia. For many rural Asians, accessing healthcare is a long and expensive journey which often begins too late.Cancer Research Malaysia has developed a mobile phone application which can capture images of the oral cavity and this can be interpreted remotely by oral medicine specialists. Although the method is sensitive and feasible, it is still expensive and time consuming, because it relies on the availability of trained oral medicine specialists. Cancer Research Malaysia has therefore collaborated with AI-experts in UM and Kingston University UK to develop AI solutions to enable rapid and robust reading of the mobile phone images\u201cAlthough Malaysia is very lucky to have universal health coverage, the coverage of cancer diagnostic services is still limited in rural settings, so those needing healthcare must commute into bigger cities in the West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia, or to Kuching and Kota Kinabalu. Such travel puts people off seeking treatment and tragically, the majority of cancer patients seek treatment when their disease has reached an advanced stage. This challenge of accessing early detection in rural settings is common in low- and middle-income countries and mobile apps powered by artificial intelligence (AI) may be its best answer,\u201d said Professor Dr. Cheong Sok Ching, Head of Head and Neck Cancer Research at Cancer Research Malaysia and one of the lead investigators in the study. The project builds on existing partnerships that we have with oral specialists in Malaysia, Nepal and Sri Lanka.\u201cThe challenge of developing deep learning algorithms and applying them to a range of images taken on a mobile phone is very exciting and we are looking forward to working with our colleagues at University of Malaya and Cancer Research Malaysia on this project which may have a global health impact\u201d said Professor Sarah Barman from Kingston University.\u201cThis is going to be a very impactful healthcare project with the innovation and insights of Artificial Intelligence. Our team can\u2019t wait to start this new challenge with experts from Cancer Research Malaysia and Kingston University,\u201d said Associate Professor Dr. Chan Chee Seng, the lead investigator from the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, UM.British High Commissioner to Malaysia Her Excellency Vicki Treadell CMG MVO, in congratulating University of Malaya, Kingston University and Cancer Research Malaysia on being awarded the UK Medical Research Council grant, said, \u201cThis is the latest example of collaboration between the UK and Malaysia in healthcare and technology. By developing an artificial intelligence solution that reads images from a mobile phone, we are making oral cancer detection more accessible not only for people in the rural areas of Malaysia, but as mobile phone penetration continues to grow, the technology could be applied more widely to address other global health issues.\u201dMalaysia has one of the highest penetration of mobile phones, with an average of 1.8 phones for every citizen, and this number could grow further in the next few years. In addition, the cost of mobile data continues to drop and together, this improves access to smartphones. With the AI-powered app for early detection of oral cancer, the woes of early detection of a visible cancer could become a thing of the past.Professor Dr. Cheong Sok Ching (left) from Cancer Research Malaysia and Associate Professor Dr. Chan Chee Seng (right) from the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, University of Malaya"

    "title": "UM RESEARCHERS DEVELOP CoSMoS: MONITORING SYSTEM FOR HOSPITAL COVID19 MANAGEMENT",
    "body": "A group of researchers from Universiti Malaya (UM) has developed the COVID Symptom Monitoring System (CoSMoS), a new system that helps to monitor patients with suspected COVID-19 infection. \u00a0The Universiti Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) has started using CoSMoS to monitor suspected COVID-19 individuals who are undergoing self-quarantine at home. The system will soon be ready for use among healthcare workers who have been exposed to COVID-19 patients.Currently, a large number of healthcare workers are required to monitor these patients by calling them daily or visiting them at home. With the CoSMoS application, this monitoring process is automated where patients can enter their daily symptoms into CoSMoS, which will then be sent to the CoSMoS centralised system at UMMC where doctors can access their information in real time via a dashboard. With CoSMoS, the healthcare workers have to call only 10% of the patients who really need care. The rest who are well can be monitored by CoSMoS daily. This will free up 80-90% of healthcare workers to conduct contact tracing and testing.Dato\u2019 Prof. Dr. Adeeba Kamarulzaman, an expert in infectious diseases, also the UMMC COVID-19 Taskforce Chair and Dean of the Faculty of Medicine in UM said \u201cCoSMoS is going to change the way we manage patients with suspected COVID-19 infection who are being monitored at home. Currently, the healthcare system is under tremendous pressure. A medical officer spends 10-15 minutes every day to call and follow-up a patient for 14 days.\u201dAdeeba added \u201cCurrently in UMMC, we have more than 1000 patients and healthcare workers who have been exposed to COVID-19 and require daily follow up, and this takes up at least 3500 man-hours. Using CoSMoS, it helps to free up the healthcare workers in UMMC from manually calling patients.CoSMoS utilises readily available technology to ensure it is affordable and accessible to the majority of the population. Patients use a Telegram Bot to report their daily symptoms in an interactive manner, thus relieving the time and cost of healthcare workers from calling the patients over the phone. The Bot will remind the patients every morning to report their symptoms, and advise patients based on their reported symptoms. CoSMoS also provides a back-end dashboard that will assist healthcare workers in managing the patients.CoSMoS is currently undergoing pilot testing at UMMC and has obtained ethical approval from the UMMC Medical Research Ethics Committee. All patients using CoSMoS have given consent for their data to be used for clinical monitoring and research.About the DevelopmentCoSMoS was developed through a close collaboration between the clinicians from the Department of Primary Care Medicine, UMMC, and \u00a0the development team consists of 30 Malaysians currently in various countries, including Malaysia, Singapore, China, and Australia. They are either studying or working in these countries and are all staffs, graduates and students of the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Universiti Malaya.Datin Prof. Dr. Sameem Abdul Kareem, the Dean of Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology said, \u201cWe have put together a team of brilliant young Malaysian computer scientists from the faculty to help our frontliners in their time of need. CoSMoS platform is 100% UM in-house development, leveraging on public messaging engine, artificial intelligence and web technology. The team has used what they have learnt in UM into a real-world solution within 8 days and as the Dean, I am very proud of them\u201d.CoSMoS Development Team"

    "body": "Dear students and staff,I hope you and your loved ones are well and safe. The recent weeks have been challenging for all of us. Despite the unprecedented disruption, I am proud of your extraordinary efforts in embracing the new normal. This is evident across the University.The University of Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) as a designated COVID-19 hospital has been immensely busy. I take this opportunity to thank colleagues from the Faculty of Medicine and other frontliners for their dedication and tireless efforts in treating and saving lives.Our researchers have been making the headlines for their contributions and innovations revealing our enormous strength as a premier research University. The profound importance of our research and data science expertise is evident in the range of initiatives undertaken by our various Faculties and Research Clusters. Teams from the Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Computer Science & Information Technology are leading the way in data collection and epidemiology study resulting in the development of a data repository platform. In the area of diagnostics, the Faculty of Medicine and the Tropical Infectious Diseases Research & Education Centre (TIDREC) have been screening and testing for COVID-19. The Faculty of Medicine and TIDREC have also been working on sequencing COVID-19 isolates from UMMC. I am happy to announce that the first COVID-19 Nanopore Sequencing has been successfully developed by our Faculty of Medicine.In the Centre for Natural Products Research and Drug Discovery (CENAR), a team is manually producing hand sanitisers in support of hygiene measures and prevention of infection. Also impressive is the initiative of students and alumni from the Faculty of Computer Science & Information Technology who have developed the Remote Electronic Medical Services, a symptom monitoring system for COVID-19 which enables remote monitoring of patients and thereby reducing the burden on hospitals.Collaborative initiatives of the Faculty of Medicine, the Faculty of Engineering and the Faculty of Computer Science & Information Technology have also resulted in the development of infrared digital thermometer prototype which employs quick body scanning methods. In UM\u2019s Chemistry Innovation Space, researchers and students are producing 3D Printing of face-shields, a simple and cost-effective production of personal protecting equipment. Also deserving mention is our Centre for Innovations in Medical Engineering for having developed and distributed intubation boxes to hospitals to protect health workers from exposure. These are just some of the initiatives being undertaken by our staff and students; not all can be listed here.At the Management level, much effort has gone into developing the University\u2019s contingency plan in managing this period and beyond. Members of the Senior Management team have been working around the clock to ensure that all aspects of operations within the various portfolios involving teaching and learning, research and innovation, student affairs and administration have been looked into and is being managed effectively.We also started a campaign on COVID-19 fundraising to assist the University, in particular our students who have been affected by the pandemic. In providing the much needed support to our students, the University has also waived the accommodation fee at all residential colleges throughout the Movement Control Order (MCO) period. Food distribution to students will also continue throughout the third phase of the MCO. We are now working on staff welfare measures and will soon reach out to those who qualify for financial assistance.It is important that we prepare ourselves for the new normal as we embark on full eLearning effective 27April 2020 and introduce alternative methods of assessment. I recognise that for many, working from home can be an arduous task. Not having the comfort of the office, the quiet space, and the company of colleagues to socialise and support one another can impact people differently. Balancing the needs of the family whilst being productive through remote working is indeed a huge challenge. With the MCO being extended until 28 April 2020, work must go on as usual, albeit remotely. Supervisors must develop a routine with their teams, set weekly goals, encourage discipline, have regular communication and support each other through the virtual environment. Strong leadership is imperative to make this work.For frontline staff who have been on campus throughout the MCO period, we are grateful for your sacrifices and dedication. For students who participated in the blood donation drive to ensure UMMC\u2019s blood bank remains at an optimal level, thank you for your act of solidarity.I thank you all for your support. Stay safe.Abdul Rahim HashimApril 13th, 2020"

The three (3) academic disciplines ranked within the Top 50 include Library and Information Management (31st rank), Development Studies (38th), and Electrical & Electronic Engineering (47th).UM scored in 46 subjects out of 48 relevant subjects, of which 34 subjects were ranked. \u00a0This overall score across the 46 subjects currently featured in the QS World University Rankings by Subjects puts UM as being a comprehensive university. This is because it is very unusual for an institution to qualify for consideration in all 48 subjects. These subject areas achievements provide important and useful information on the performance of a university as 1,222 institutions have been ranked this year.In the broad subject areas ranking, Engineering & Technology is UM\u2019s strongest field and is ranked at 38 with an overall score of 84.5. This was followed by Social Sciences & Management with a rank of 55 and an overall score of 77.4. \u00a0Although UM\u2019s Academic and Employer Reputations indicators have dipped for some subjects, UM\u2019s Citation per Paper and H-Index scores continues to increase.UM\u2019s Vice-Chancellor, Datuk Ir. (Dr.) Abdul Rahim Hj. Hashim emphasized that UM\u2019s Strategic Plan needs to be relooked as improvements in teaching and learning requires provision of high quality academic programmes in this Industrial Revolution (IR) 4.0 economy. He recognized that UM is now facing enormous challenges to moving further ahead, in view of the financial constraints. These challenges arising from the current economic conditions require also that the University needs to find additional sources of funding and venture into income-generating activities to support its internationalization efforts, and to continue to intensify research. Datuk Abdul Rahim believes that UM will need strong support from both the Malaysian Government and industries in order for UM to make further advances.Datuk Abdul Rahim also thanked the Ministry of Education for its continued support. \u00a0He hopes that the UM community will continue to put in concerted efforts to build a stronger academic future in the coming years."

    "body": "Universiti Malaya, in collaboration with Epro Advance Technology from Hong Kong, announced on 13 Dec 2023, the world\u2019s first silicon-fueled hydrogen genset. It is an innovative solution to replace highly polluting diesel gensets that power construction sites, serve as backup power units in commercial buildings, chemical industries, and data centers, among others.The silicon-fueled hydrogen genset allows ultrapure hydrogen to be generated on demand and off-grid. Due to its high purity, the hydrogen can be used directly in a fuel cell to produce electricity. The typical use of fuel cells requires a significant amount of hydrogen storage at high pressure or under cryogenic temperatures on-site, presenting a safety hazard as hydrogen is highly flammable. Instead, the silicon-fueled genset produces hydrogen on demand (where electricity is required). That way, only a minimal amount of hydrogen is stored on-site.Vice-Chancellor of Universiti Malaya, Professor Dato\u2019 Seri Ir. Dr. Nor Azuan Abu Osman, in his speech during the launch, said that he is immensely honored to preside over this inaugural event, marking a new chapter for Universiti Malaya in its collaborations with leading innovators in the industry. This momentous occasion signifies not just a ceremony but a symbolic leap towards a future where academic and real-world applications converge seamlessly.\u201cThe culmination of our joint enterprise is the creation of the first-ever silicon-fueled hydrogen genset, a revolutionary technology poised to redefine energy standards. This project, born from three years of intensive research and partnership, stands as a testament to our dedication and expertise. The hydrogen genset represents a significant leap in green technology, offering an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional diesel gensets,\u201d he added.\u201cThe launched genset shall be shipped immediately to its first customer, a major construction company in Hong Kong. The subsequent international orders include those in the energy, fisheries and mining industries, where decarbonization solutions are urgently required.\u201d quipped Mr Albert Lau, the Chief Executive Officer of Epro Advance Technology.According to Universiti Malaya\u2019s researcher from the Faculty of Engineering, Associate Professor Dr. Wey Yang Teoh, the other inherent advantage of the silicon-fueled hydrogen genset lies in the silicon itself. The proprietary nanoporous silicon, which is safe and does not require special handling, can be manufactured anywhere that has an abundance of renewable energies \u2013 be it Bakun Dam in Sarawak, wind farms in the North Sea, or solar farms in the desert of Xian, China.\u201cThe silicon as an energy carrier can be easily transported, regionally or across continents. When reaching the site, the silicon can be easily converted to hydrogen and further to electricity through the genset. In other words, the technology allows the redistribution of renewable hydrogen/energy throughout the world in a safe, practical, and efficient manner. This is, in fact, the biggest bottleneck in the implementation of the global hydrogen economy.\u201cMoreover, the byproduct of silicate produced from hydrogen generation can be easily converted to high-performance, structural green concrete \u2013 in itself a product of high demand. The launch of the technology surrounding the silicon-fueled hydrogen genset is regarded as a significant stepping stone in charting the path forward for Malaysia and the world in the highly competitive hydrogen economy,\u201d Dr. Wey Yang Teoh said.Professor Dato\u2019 Seri Ir. Dr. Nor Azuan Abu Osman also announced a collaboration with Epro Advance Technology to set up the World\u2019s first silicon-fueled hydrogen refuelling station. The collaboration includes replacing the university shuttle buses that currently run on fossil fuels with clean hydrogen buses. The Vice-Chancellor has every intention to convert the university ground to a testbed for home-grown, cutting-edge technologies."

    "title": "UM ASTRONOMERS PART OF TEAM TO CAPTURE THE FIRST IMAGES OF BLACK HOLE REALITY",
    "body": "Astronomers from University of Malaya (UM) were part of the international team that made the first images of Black Hole. The images were captured using the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) \u2013 a planet-scale array of eight ground-based radio telescopes forged through international collaboration \u2013 was designed to capture images of a black hole. On 10 April 2019, in coordinated press conferences across the globe, EHT researchers reveal that they have succeeded, unveiling the first direct visual evidence of a supermassive black hole and its shadow.This breakthrough was announced today in a series of six papers published in a special issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters. The image reveals the black hole at the centre of Messier 87[1], a massive galaxy in the nearby Virgo galaxy cluster. This black hole resides 55 million light-years from Earth and has a mass 6.5-billion times that of the Sun[2].The EHT links telescopes around the globe to form an Earth-sized virtual telescope with unprecedented sensitivity and resolution[3]. The EHT is the result of years of international collaboration, and offers scientists a new way to study the most extreme objects in the Universe predicted by Einstein\u2019s general relativity during the centennial year of the historic experiment that first confirmed the theory[4].\"We have taken the first picture of a black hole,\" said EHT project director Sheperd S. Doeleman of the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian. \"This is an extraordinary scientific feat accomplished by a team of more than 200 researchers.\"Black holes are extraordinary cosmic objects with enormous masses but extremely compact sizes. The presence of these objects affects their environment in extreme ways, warping spacetime and super-heating any surrounding material.\"If immersed in a bright region, like a disc of glowing gas, we expect a black hole to create a dark region similar to a shadow \u2014 something predicted by Einstein\u2019s general relativity that we\u2019ve never seen before,\" explained chair of the EHT Science Council Heino Falcke of Radboud University, the Netherlands.\"This shadow, caused by the gravitational bending and capture of light by the event horizon, reveals a lot about the nature of these fascinating objects and allowed us to measure the enormous mass of M87\u2019s black hole.\"Multiple calibration and imaging methods have revealed a ring-like structure with a dark central region \u2014 the black hole\u2019s shadow \u2014 that persisted over multiple independent EHT observations.\"Once we were sure we had imaged the shadow, we could compare our observations to extensive computer models that include the physics of warped space, superheated matter and strong magnetic fields. Many of the features of the observed image match our theoretical understanding surprisingly well,\" remarks Paul T.P. Ho, EHT Board member and Director of the East Asian Observatory[5]. \"This makes us confident about the interpretation of our observations, including our estimation of the black hole\u2019s mass.\"Creating the EHT was a formidable challenge which required upgrading and connecting a worldwide network of eight pre-existing telescopes deployed at a variety of challenging high-altitude sites. These locations included volcanoes in Hawai`i and Mexico, mountains in Arizona and the Spanish Sierra Nevada, the Chilean Atacama Desert, and Antarctica.The EHT observations use a technique called very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) which synchronises telescope facilities around the world and exploits the rotation of our planet to form one huge, Earth-size telescope observing at a wavelength of 1.3mm. VLBI allows the EHT to achieve an angular resolution of 20 micro-arcseconds \u2014 enough to read a newspaper in New York from a sidewalk caf\u00e9 in Paris[6].The telescopes contributing to this result were ALMA, APEX, the IRAM 30-meter telescope, the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, the Large Millimeter Telescope Alfonso Serrano, the Submillimeter Array, the Submillimeter Telescope, and the South Pole Telescope[7]. Petabytes of raw data from the telescopes were combined by highly specialised supercomputers hosted by the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy and MIT Haystack Observatory.The construction of the EHT and the observations announced today represent the culmination of decades of observational, technical, and theoretical work. This example of global teamwork required close collaboration by researchers from around the world. Thirteen partner institutions worked together to create the EHT, using both pre-existing infrastructure and support from a variety of agencies. Key funding was provided by the US National Science Foundation (NSF), the EU's European Research Council (ERC), and funding agencies in East Asia.UM contributed to the project.\u00a0 \u201cWe are at the edge of a new era, where we can directly see black holes, objects for the science fiction and popular imagination just few years ago\u201d said Juan Carlos Algaba, VLBI expert of the Radio Cosmology Laboratory in the Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, UM.\u201cThis will definitely boost the role of Malaysian astronomy, which so far counts with the UPSI-UM 7-meter Radio Telescope in Tanjung Malim, Perak.\u201d, said Zamri Zainal Abidin, investigator and Head of the Radio Cosmology Laboratory, Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, UM.\"We have achieved something presumed to be impossible just a generation ago,\" concluded Doeleman. \"Breakthroughs in technology, connections between the world's best radio observatories, and innovative algorithms all came together to open an entirely new window on black holes and the event horizon.\"Notes[1]The shadow of a black hole is the closest we can come to an image of the black hole itself, a completely dark object from which light cannot escape. The black hole\u2019s boundary \u2014 the event horizon from which the EHT takes its name \u2014 is around 2.5 times smaller than the shadow it casts and measures just under 40 billion km across.[2]Supermassive black holes are relatively tiny astronomical objects \u2014 which has made them impossible to directly observe until now. As a black hole\u2019s size is proportional to its mass, the more massive a black hole, the larger the shadow. Thanks to its enormous mass and relative proximity, M87\u2019s black hole was predicted to be one of the largest viewable from Earth \u2014 making it a perfect target for the EHT.[3]Although the telescopes are not physically connected, they are able to synchronize their recorded data with atomic clocks \u2014 hydrogen masers \u2014 which precisely time their observations. These observations were collected at a wavelength of 1.3 mm during a 2017 global campaign. Each telescope of the EHT produced enormous amounts of data \u2013 roughly 350 terabytes per day \u2013 which was stored on high-performance helium-filled hard drives. These data were flown to highly specialised supercomputers \u2014 known as correlators \u2014 at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy and MIT Haystack Observatory to be combined. They were then painstakingly converted into an image using novel computational tools developed by the collaboration.[4]100 years ago, two expeditions set out for the island of Pr\u00edncipe off the coast of Africa and Sobral in Brazil to observe the 1919 solar eclipse, with the goal of testing general relativity by seeing if starlight would be bent around the limb of the sun, as predicted by Einstein. In an echo of those observations, the EHT has sent team members to some of the world's highest and isolated radio facilities to once again test our understanding of gravity.[5]The East Asian Observatory (EAO) partner on the EHT project represents the participation of many regions in Asia, including China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, India and Indonesia.[6]Future EHT observations will see substantially increased sensitivity with the participation of the IRAM NOEMA Observatory, the Greenland Telescope and the Kitt Peak Telescope.[7]ALMA is a partnership of the European Southern Observatory (ESO; Europe, representing its member states), the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), and the National Institutes of Natural Sciences(NINS) of Japan, together with the National Research Council (Canada), the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST; Taiwan), Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA; Taiwan), and Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI; Republic of Korea), in cooperation with the Republic of Chile. APEX is operated by ESO, the 30-meter telescope is operated by IRAM (the IRAM Partner Organizations are MPG (Germany), CNRS (France) and IGN (Spain)), the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope is operated by the EAO, the Large Millimeter Telescope Alfonso Serrano is operated by INAOE and UMass, the Submillimeter Array is operated by SAO and ASIAA and the Submillimeter Telescope is operated by the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO). The South Pole Telescope is operated by the University of Chicago with specialized EHT instrumentation provided by the University of Arizona.Using the Event Horizon Telescope, scientists obtained an image of the black hole at the center of galaxy M87, outlined by emission from hot gas swirling around it under the influence of strong gravity near its event horizon."

It has scored and delivered commercial projects for various organisations, including PETRONAS, Employees Provident Fund (EPF) and Hong Leong Islamic.Fylix as a business initiative has proven to be highly successful and profitable with its range of AI solutions, that has competed with the likes of IBM\u2019s Watson and TATA Industries at different levels of commercialization. Fylix is the brainchild of three UM\u2019s academicians from FCSIT, Dr. Ram Gopal Raj, Dr. Aznul Qalid Md Sabri and Dr. Hairul Nizam Md Nasir. Another factor that sets Fylix apart is that, Fylix engineers are all students or alumni of UM (with most of them from FSCIT), ranging from undergraduates to postgraduates. It is evident that FCSIT UM, had been the centerpiece in ensuring that Fylix is a commercial success.Fylix provides a range of AI-based solutions, as follows:KRISPIwhich is a localized, intelligent and easy to train AI-powered chatbot (won TNB\u2019s Botathon in 2016 and side-lined TATA Industries as well as IBM Watson); andPRIDE,\u00a0a data extractor, that has the ability to convert unstructured data from raw documents, into pre-defined structured templates.

In addition, their learning experience is further enhanced by the support and opportunities provided by the embassies of Spanish speaking countries.On 27 May 2016, a Spanish corner was inaugurated in the library of the Faculty of Languages and Linguistics graced by His Excellency Carlos Dom\u00ednguez D\u00edaz, the Ambassador of Spain and Prof. Dr. Kamila Ghazali, the Associate Vice Chancellor of International. The large number of books which were donated by the Embassy of Spain form a very significant contribution to the faculty's library. The books were selected by the faculty members together with members of the embassy and the selection was made based on their relevance in the teaching and learning of the Spanish language. What makes these books special is also the fact that they are not readily available locally and had to be purchased in Spain.The establishment of the Spanish corner not only helped to showcase the good partnership and support between UM and the Spanish embassy, but also further strengthened the university\u2019s ties with embassies of other Spanish speaking countries.

Oleh itu, mereka terpaksa membeli ubat CBD yang dijual secara underground di Malaysia tetapi mestilah mahal jika dibandingkan dengan ubat-ubatan lain yang sedia ada. Oleh itu, sudah sampai masanya, negara kita membangunkan penyelidikan supaya ubat berasaskan kenabis ini dapat digunakan dan mungkin dilaksanakan sendiri di Malaysia di samping meningkatkan ekonomi negara sebagai pengeluar utama ubat \u2013 ubatan berasaskan kanabis.\u201cKenabis dikatakan boleh digunakan bagi rawatan penyakit-penyakit seperti sawan, autisma, penahan sakit kronik, anti-kemurungan dan kegelisahan, anti-psikotik, rawatan dementia dan saraf. Produk kanabis pernah dipasarkan di Malaysia iaitu Sativa X untuk penyakit multiple sclerosis tetapi dikeluarkan oleh biro farmasautikal kerana kurang mendapat respon pasaran,\u201d katanya.Malaysia pernah mengeluarkan kegunaan ubat methadone yang juga pada suatu Ketika dibawah DDA 1952, bagi merawat penagihan heroin dan menangani HIV/AIDS dikalangan penagih yang berkongsi jarum suntikan.

Valentine Fernandez ketika ditemui baru-baru ini.\u201cSatu lagi yang menarik ialah apabila menjadi pemandu untuk program-program khas seperti mesyuarat Naib-Naib Canselor dan Rektor UA anjuran Kementerian Pengajian Tinggi (KPT). Dan tentunya yang paling unik ialah ketika majlis penganugerahan ijazah kedoktoran khas untuk Raja Salman Abdul Aziz pada 2017, apabila saya menjadi sebahagian daripada kumpulan pemandu yang bertugas,\u201d sambungnya lagi.Lelaki berusia 59 tahun ini merupakan pemandu yang berkhidmat dengan Jabatan Pengurusan dan Penyenggaraan Harta Benda (JPPHB) UM sejak tahun 2004. \u201cSaya akan bersara bulan Ogos tahun hadapan. So bolehlah rilek sikit; mungkin saya akan berniaga, kita tengoklah macam mana,\u201d katanya memulakan perbualan.\u201cSaya dilahirkan dan dibesarkan di Sentul, Kuala Lumpur. Saya bersekolah di SK dan SMK La Salle di Sentul. Sekitar 1986, ayah saya bekerja dengan Keretapi Malaysia Berhad (KTMB) dan sejak itu kami tinggal di kuarters kakitangan yang terletak berhampiran dengan stesen KTMB di Kuala Kubu Bharu, Selangor sehingga 1996,\u201d katanya mengimbau masa lalu yang membesar dengan 10 orang adik-beradik.\u201cSaya anak orang miskin, belajar pun tak tinggi. Jadi apabila berpeluang menyumbang tenaga di UM, saya sangat happy. Isteri saya juga bertugas di UM. Kami mendirikan rumahtangga pada 1996 dan menetap di kawasan sekitar Kampung Kerinchi sejak dulu hingga sekarang,\u201d katanya lagi.\u201cI am very proud to be a Malaysian. I am a Christian, and yet is surrounded by my extended families who are Hindu. And yet we still live harmoniously. Even my mother and my wife is a Hindu. And we celebrate both Deepavali and Christmas every year with everyone,\u201d kata En Valentine yang fasih berbahasa Melayu dan Inggeris.Apabila ditanya mengenai pesanan kepada warga kampus: \u201cTo all staff of UM, we should all strive to do your best in whatever we do. Be punctual, respect others, and follow all rules and regulations. Take good care of your attendance records, because it is proof of your discipline and dedication towards work.Walaupun saya tidak mempunyai anak, tapi saya anggap mahasiswa di UM semuanya sebagai anak-anak saya. Merekalah harapan dan masa depan negara kita. I am proud that I am part of a very important institution to the country.

    "body": "DATO\u2019 Seri Idris Jusoh, was all smiles when he attended the launch of the state of the art treatment facility \u2013 the Centre for Image Guided and Minimally Invasive Theraphy (CIGMIT) at the University of Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) recently.The Minister of Higher Education was highly impressed with the modern facilities offered by CIGMIT, one of two international treatment centres (after Singapore) featuring two integrated intraoperative MRI and CT scanners and a radiosurgery suite.\u201cThese operating theatres are unique, where patients' safety, cost effectiveness and efficiency form the core of its design philosophy.\u201cThe two - room solution allows the scanners to be available for diagnostic imaging while operations are going on in the other room. When an intraoperative scan is needed, either for navigation or to assess resection margin, the CT scan can be brought into the operating room. As for the intraoperative MRI, although it requires a particular transport table, the patient can be to moved easily from the operating room as the MRI is located in the adjacent MRI suite.\u201cIn other words, CIGMIT helps in saving valuable lives. The centre also provides medical students with the necessary exposure needed in honing their skills, performing real life procedures in the operating theatre.\u201cThis is a good example of the public-private partnership initiative and I can\u2019t praise UM highly enough for their foresight and vision in making this a reality,\u201d he added.The idea for setting up the Centre for Image Guided and Minimally Invasive Therapy was first mooted in order that doctors who have acquired higher surgical skills during overseas training would have access to an operating theatre with state of the art equipment that is equivalent to what they have been exposed in their training. As a result of the initiative taken by the Malaysian government to form Public-Private Partnerships, the idea for CIGMIT was finally realised.CIGMIT provides a symbiotic relationship between various surgical divisions such as radiology and oncology in treating tumors. An integrated network of scanners and image guided surgical equipment facilitates the workflow from the diagnosis, surgical option and through to the follow-up care. Intraoperative scans allow the surgeons to perform more complicated surgeries, reduce the operating time, and increase safety margin for the patients. While CIGMIT provides better care for patients, at the same time it also offers state of the art training facilities to for the undergraduate and postgraduate students.By Harris Rajahdin"

    "title": "Donations Boost Research to Improve Treatment Outcomes for Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukaemia",
    "body": "Unlike those with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia where overall cure rates are above 80%, children with the rarer, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) suffer more morbidities and have a poorer outcome.Despite intensive chemotherapy, disease relapse remains a major challenge. In addition, many children with AML who should undergo bone marrow transplantation as a curative means are unable to do so due to the lack of matched sibling donor. Currently, the cure rate for children with AML in University of Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) is only 35-40%.\u201cThe first step required to save these children is to identify which ones are not responding well enough to chemotherapy so that their treatment can be intensified and they can be fast-tracked to transplantation.Our traditional method of examining their post-treatment bone marrow samples through a microscope lacks accuracy and we need a more sophisticated method like using flow cytometry to detect residual leukaemia cells,\u201d said Professor Hany Ariffin, who heads the paediatric haematology-oncology and haematopoetic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) unit at UMMC.One of the team\u2019s scientists, SLAB trainee Shafiq Azanan, is currently undergoing a training stint in the laboratory of Professor Dario Campana of St Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital to acquire the necessary skills to detect these \u2018hidden\u2019 AML cells in sequential bone marrow samples.The other challenge is to enable children who need HSCT to be able to undergo this procedure even if they do not have a suitable brother or sister to be a donor. To circumvent this problem, Professor Hany and her team are pioneering paediatric haploidentical HSCT in UMMC ; opening new opportunities for children without a matched sibling donor.UM\u2019s war against childhood AML has garnered support from various quarters. Recently, Mr Tony Siew, whose son was afflicted with AML at the tender age of 8 months and his friends raised RM100,000 for the cause.\u201cThere were many moments during chemotherapy when I thought I was going to lose my son from this terrible disease. He is a happy and active boy now thanks to the tireless efforts of the UMMC team. I want to help other children with AML to get a similar shot at life like my son, too,\u201d said Mr Siew.Another supporter, WAP International Sdn Bhd chief executive, Jennifer Ong who has been contributing to children\u2019s causes for many years decided this year to focus on AML research with a donation of RM80,000, as it was an area of immediate need.On 14 September 2016 a simple cheque hand-over ceremony was held at the office of the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research and Innovation).At the event, the Deputy Vice Chancellor, Professor Dr Noorsaadah thanked the generous donors and expressed her hope that UM academics would continue to pioneer translational research with direct impact to the community and nation.Norlin GhazaliFaculty of Medicine"

    "title": "CEPI AND UNIVERSITI MALAYA ANNOUNCE NEW COLLABORATION TO ADVANCE NIPAH VIRUS RESEARCH",
    "body": "The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has partnered with Universiti Malaya (UM), Malaysia, to further research and scientific understanding into the Nipah virus - one of the deadliest pathogens known to infect humans.Under the new partnership, CEPI will provide up to US $188,000 in funding to support UM\u2019s work to collect biological material from Nipah survivors to characterize and better understand immune responses generated against the virus. As Nipah outbreaks are typically sporadic with few survivors, the work is set to provide critical new information on Nipah immunology that has not previously been studied, such as looking at the types of immune cells (eg T cells and antibody-secreting cells) involved in responding to the virus, with an emphasis on \u201cmemory\u201d cells.To carry out the research, UM will collaborate with physicians and healthcare workers who responded to the first-ever documented Nipah virus outbreak in Malaysia in 1998/1999. Occurring over two decades after the event, the work is therefore set to play a key role in documenting long-term evidence on Nipah survivor biology, including studying the level of long-term immunity maintained over time.The biological material collected from survivors will also speed up the development of vaccine tests (known as assays) and reference tools, like an international antibody standard, which could be used by vaccine developers to assess and compare the performance of future Nipah vaccines, including those funded by CEPI.This effort will advance one of CEPI\u2019s goals, announced as part of its$3.5bn planin March, 2021, to bring a Nipah vaccine, or other biological countermeasure, to licensure. It will also support CEPI\u2019s aim to enhance and expand global collaboration by working with UM and entities within the region to build a more robust and effective global preparedness and response architecture.\u201cNipah virus remains a deadly risk to South and Southeast Asia and it is pivotal that we continue to progress our scientific knowledge of this epidemic threat\u201d saidDr. Melanie Saville, Director of Vaccine R&D at CEPI.\u201cI am therefore delighted to welcome UM to the coalition, providing CEPI and the global scientific community with critical information to aid our understanding of the virus. As Malaysia was the country where the Nipah virus was first discovered back in 1998, this new partnership will also provide us with a unique opportunity to better understand and learn from the historical, scientific, and cultural aspects surrounding the initial response to a previously unknown pathogen.\u201dA deadly epidemic threatNipah virus is a potentially fatal zoonotic disease, spread to people by interaction withPteropusbats (flying foxes)\u2014the natural hosts of the virus\u2014as well as infected pigs or humans, or through contaminated food or food products, like bat-bitten fruit or date palm sap, contaminated with bat excreta. Infection can cause severe, rapidly progressive illness that affects the respiratory system and the central nervous system, including inflammation of the brain (encephalitis).After its discovery in 1998/1999 through an outbreak in pigs and pig farmers in Malaysia and Singapore, where over 100 human deaths were reported, the virus has continued to spread over thousands of kilometres to Bangladesh and India, causing severe disease and recorded mortality rates of between 40 and 90%. One of the most recent outbreaks in Kerala, India, in 2018 claimed 17 of the 19 infected with the disease. There is also concern of the virus spreading more widely given thatPteropusbats are found across regions of Africa, South Asia and Oceania that are home to more than two billion people.World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) R&D Blueprintlists Nipah virus as an emerging infectious disease in need of urgent R&D action.Advancing Nipah vaccinesWith no vaccines or specific therapeutics approved for human use, CEPI is leading efforts to better protect against Nipah virus with four candidate vaccines in itsportfolio, includingAuro Vaccines and PATH\u2019svaccine candidate \u2013 the first Nipah vaccine to be tested in humans. Further testing, assessing the safety of and immunogenicity elicited by these vaccine candidates, is set to take place over the next few years.Research conducted by the UM Team will therefore be important for these later-stage (Phase II and beyond) Nipah vaccine trials through increasing understanding of how the body naturally elicits an immune response to the virus and comparing this to the level of protection elicited by vaccines under development. The biological material collected from Nipah survivors will also be used for the development of an antibody standard, a tool developed to act as a set reference point to assess whether a vaccine under clinical evaluation is likely to be a \u2018good\u2019 vaccine (inducing a sufficient immune response in vaccinated individuals)[1].Results on the studies will be shared through open-access publications and via scientific meetings with vaccine developers (including both CEPI-funded and non-CEPI funded developers) to ensure all can benefit from the research.\u201cNipah virus, which is one of the world\u2019s deadliest pathogens, was brought to light by UM when patients from the outbreak were admitted to the UM Medical Centre (UMMC), Kuala Lumpur for treatment,\u201d saidProfessor Dr. April Camilla Roslani, Dean at the Faculty of Medicine, UM.\u201cSince then, UM and the UMMC team have contributed enormously to many of the breakthroughs in understanding of the Nipah virus, thus laying the foundation for the control of future outbreak and management of the patients. The many valuable lessons learnt in the fight against Nipah virus have positioned Malaysia in the forefront, especially in addressing topics pertaining to infectious diseases and vaccine development.\u201cUM is committed to communicating and sharing knowledge with an open-minded approach to collaborative research that will contribute to global knowledge transfer and societal well-being, in line with UM\u2019s tagline \u201cServing the Nation, Impacting the World\u201d. Therefore, UM looks forward to the collaborative research with CEPI in developing Nipah antibody standards and vaccines,\u201d she added.The agreement between CEPI and the UM may subsequently be expanded to include further investigation into viral immunology and/or to extend the development of internationally endorsed tools to assess Nipah vaccine performance.[1] The biological material collected from Nipah survivors will be used for the development of an interim antibody standard with the expectation to develop a subsequent international standard. Already existing for other diseases, including COVID-19, anantibody standard is a pool of serum samples from patients who have been infected and recovered from a disease, developed to act as a \u2018gold standard\u2019 to assess whether a vaccine under clinical evaluation is likely to be a \u2018good\u2019 vaccine (inducing a sufficient immune response in vaccinated individuals).Through evaluating trial samples relative to a set reference point (the antibody standard), vaccine makers can have confidence in the immunogenicity levels produced by their vaccine candidates, while also allowing research groups to make comparisons between the different COVID-19 vaccines in development."

Tenunan limar yang terdiri daripada beraneka ragam seni hias dan teknik penghasilan. Seperti yang kita ketahui limar tidak lagi dihasilkan secara meluas, namun demikian terdapat usaha pihak-pihak tertentu khususnya penenun-penenun tempatan.Pengerusi Lembaga Pengarah Universiti, Tan Sri Zarinah Anwar berkata, \u201cberdasarkan penyelidikan bersama dengan penggiat seni warisan, Muzium Seni Asia Universiti Malaya telah mengenal pasti dua helai kain Limar bersongket yang cukup istimewa bukan sahaja dari segi kualiti seni pembuatannya tetapi juga dari sejarah penggunaannya. Kain limar bersongket tersebut dalam peringkat untuk didaftarkan sebagai Objek Warisan Kebangsaan.\u201cDua kain tersebut merupakan hasil kerja tangan terbaik serta telah digunakan di istana berdasarkan motif cogan yang merupakan simbol diraja. Sekiranya diluluskan, ia dapat memberi nilai tambah yang eksklusif kepada himpunan koleksi sedia ada di Muzium ini. Inisiatif yang diambil adalah langkah yang sangat relevan dengan tujuan utama sebuah institusi muzium. Ia bertepatan dengan fungsi Muzium itu sendiri yang antara lain sebagai sebuah institusi bagi mengumpul, memelihara dan berkongsi ilmu khazanah warisan ketara dan tidak ketara.\u201cPada hari ini legasi Pak Engku dalam memartabatkan kesenian budaya dan warisan telah diteruskan oleh anakandanya iaitu Tan Sri Zeti Akhtar Aziz. Untuk makluman hadirin sekalian, Tan Sri Zeti telah berbesar hati menaja percetakan buku bertajuk Limar: Tenunan Warisan Melayu Koleksi Universiti Malaya yang diterbitkan bersempena pameran Limar ini,\u201d katanya.Kurator Muzium Seni Asia, Zahirah Noor Zainal Abidin berkata, menyelusuri sejarah, Limar didakwa diilhamkan daripada sejenis kain import dari India bernama patola. Tekstil patola ini banyak dieksport ke kepulauan nusantara sejak abad ke-16 lagi dan amat diminati oleh golongan istana. Kain ini dikatakan cukup rumit untuk dihasilkan kerana menggunakan teknik double ikat atau ikat ganda yang mana memerlukan kedua-dua benang suteranya iaitu loseng dan pakan diikat dan diwarnakan terlebih dahulu sebelum ditenun menerusi proses tie and dye. Bagaimanapun setibanya di Alam Melayu rakyat tempatan menggelar ia sebagai kain cindai.\u201cDengan keindahan dan seni pembuatannya yang cukup menarik itu, tidak hairanlah kain import ini menjadi pilihan dan kegemaran penduduk alam melayu yang seterusnya menjadikan ia sebagai sumber ilham penghasilan tekstil bercitarasa tempatan yang dikenali sebagai kain limar\u201cDiharap juga dengan pameran dan penerbitan katalog ini\u00a0 dapat memberi peluang kepada masyarakat terutama generasi muda untuk mengetahui lebih mendalam tentang keunikan dan sejarah tenunan yang cukup bernilai ini menerusi aspek sejarah, kaedah penghasilan, jenis dan penggunaannya. \u00a0Seterusnya mampu menimbulkan minat serta kebanggaan kepada mereka yang baharu mengenali keistimewaan dan keindahan kain tenunan ini,\u201d katanya."

Dr. Mohd Hamdi Abd Shukor, the Dean of the Faculty of Science, Universiti Malaya, Prof. Dr. Zulqarnain Mohamed, the Rector of Universitas Negeri Malang, Prof. Dr. Hariyono, and the Dean of the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Universitas Negeri Malang, Prof. Dr. Hadi Suwono.This collaboration includes the sharing of expertise in material science knowledge, human resources, research facilities, and research grants such as matching grants between the universities, international grants, and internal grants for both parties. Universitas Negeri Malang has expertise in advanced materials science for renewable energy, as well as various fabrication and characterization technologies for advanced materials.\"In the current energy crisis owing to the depletion of fossil fuel, harvesting the solar power into chemical energy, particularly hydrogen, is an alternative solution, due to its clean energy resource. Through this collaboration, we will working together to synthesize new 2D materials (such as tungsten carbides, WC) using an in-house hot-wire chemical vapor deposition (HWCVD) system. These new atomically thin WC nanosheets possess large-surface active area, highly metallic, and excellent catalytic properties are expected to show high performance in hydrogen evolution reaction via electrocatalysis. Moreover, the HWCVD technique which is developed from our group, is a very versatile technique to synthesis various new 2D materials including transition metal carbides and nitrides\" said Associate Professor Dr. Goh Boon Tong.The project involves synthesis of tungsten carbides using an in-house HWCVD high-vacuum system at the Low Dimensional Materials Research Center, Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Universiti Malaya. The produced high-quality WC nanosheets will undergo several advanced characterizations such as micro-Raman scattering spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The obtained data will be analyzed in detailed and correlated with the experimental parameters and the density functional theory simulated results. The results and discussion will be conducted together with the collaborators from Universitas Negeri Malang for the project report and conclusion. The synthesis process will undergo the optimization for the reproducibility test and electrode fabrication after the solid conclusions on the fundamental have been made. After the optimization, we will fabricate a 2D material electrode following to the optimized parameters and the as-prepared 2D material electrodes (WC and hetero-structured WC/W2C) will be investigated for their hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance via electrocatalysis, Dr. Zarina Binti Aspanut, the co-investigator added. Furthermore, the preliminary results show that the WC-electrode having much better performance in water-splitting process under the visible light irradiation as compared to tungsten nanoparticle and graphene-electrodes produced by the similar system (Figure 1). This is mainly attributed to the single-crystal of WC and large-surface active area of this transition metal-based 2D material.The objectives and potential outcomes to be achieved through this MoA include the report on the optimized conditions of synthesis new 2D WC nanosheets by the in-house HWCVD, presentation of the findings at local and international conferences, publication, and patent filling."

    "body": "KUALA LUMPUR, 13 Januari - Musibah banjir yang melanda Pantai Timur baru-baru ini disifatkan yang paling buruk melanda negara sejak Bah Merah pada 1967.Kemusnahan harta benda menjangkaui jutaan ringgit, ramai penduduk kehilangan tempat tinggal dan mata pencarian serta kerosakan bangunan pejabat, kedai dan sekolah menjadikan bencana ini antara yang paling dahsyat terutamanya buat penduduk Kelantan.Dr Ismail serta kumpulan penyelidik dari UM bergambar bersama warga kerja SMK Tengku Panglima RajaKini, lebih tiga minggu selepas Bah Kuning yang melanda itu, usaha kini ditumpukan ke arah pembersihan rumah, pejabat, kedai dan sekolah terutamanya di kawasan teruk yang dilanda banjir, Kuala Krai, Gua Musang, Tanah Merah dan Tumpat.Antara masalah yang perlu dihadapi penduduk di kawasan-kawasan terbabit adalah kesukaran untuk mendapatkan bekalan air bersih bagi kegunaan minuman dan pembersihan kawasan sekitar.Justeru itu, pihak Jabatan Geologi, Fakulti Sains, Universiti Malaya dengan kerjasama rakan industri, Water Jaya Sdn Bhd yang berpangkalan di Seremban mengambil inisiatif untuk memasang telaga tiub di tiga buah sekolah di Pasir Mas dan dua di Tanah Merah.Menurut ketua projek, Prof. Madya Dr Ismail Yusoff yang juga pensyarah Jabatan Geologi, pihaknya mengambil masa lima hari untuk memasang lima tiub itu sejak 9 Januari lalu.\u201cIdea untuk memasang telaga ini datang daripada pihak sekolah yang memohon bantuan kami. Kami melawat sekolah-sekolah terbabit dan mengenal pasti lokasi terbaik untuk memasang telaga tersebut.\u201cSekolah-sekolah yang memohon bantuan kami antaranya Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Tendong, Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Bunut Susu dan Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Tengku Panglima Raja yang terletak di Pasir Mas.\u201cDua lagi sekolah, Sekolah Kebangsaan Kampong Panjang dan Masjid Mukim Gobek pula terletak di Tanah Merah. Sehingga kini pihak kami sudah siap memasang kesemua telaga tiub di lima lokasi,\u201d katanya.Menurut Dr Ismail, sumber mata air telaga ini datang daripada lapisan pasir atau \u2018sand aquifer\u2019 yang terletak dalam lingkungan 10m di bawah permukaan bumi.\u201cTeknologi ini membolehkan sekolah-sekolah terbabit mendapatkan bekalan air segera. Satu lubang telaga digali secara semburan air atau \u201cwater jetting\u201d ke lapisan sumber air tanah.\u201cSelepas itu, air yang terkumpul di dalam tangki akan melalui dua sistem tapisan. Tapisan pertama akan membuang kandungan besi dalam air secara pengoksidaan.\u201cTangki kedua pula akan melalui proses tapisan kedua seperti yang digunakan di kawasan perumahan. Untuk mendapatkan lebih kepastian mengenai tahap kebersihan air, pihak sekolah diminta menghantar sampel air tersebut ke Jabatan Kimia Malaysia untuk diuji.\u201cDari segi kualiti air di Kelantan, secara amnya air di Kelantan ini memiliki kandungan besi yang tinggi dan berbau. Air tapisan yang diperoleh di sini pula tidak berbau dan jernih dan ia memberikan indikasi tentang tahap kebersihan air di sini.\u201cSecara keseluruhan, kos untuk memasang satu telaga ini dianggarkan RM8,000,\u201d tambahnya.Menurutnya lagi, air ini kemudian boleh disalurkan ke seluruh sekolah dan kantin dan selamat digunakan.Naib Canselor UM, Profesor Dato\u2019 Dr. Mohd Amin Jalaludin menandatangi buku kenang-kenangan sempena kunjungannya ke SMK Tengku Panglima RajaDr Ismail (dua dari kiri) dan Naib Canselor UM, Profesor Dato\u2019 Dr. Mohd Amin Jalaludin (empat dari kiri) bergambar bersama pasukan penyelidik dan warga kerja SMK Tengku Panglima Raja"

    "body": "The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration discovers image of the black hole in polarised light by the astronomers around the world, including from Universiti Malaya (UM).Dr. Juan Carlos Algaba Marcos from the Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, UM has been part of 300 scientists from around the world that involved in the data analysis and parameter survey for the calibration of the data and the imaging results.\u201cThis is the first time ever that anyone has been able to obtain polarized light from such a tiny region around the black hole. This setup allowed the team to directly observe the black hole shadow and the ring of light around it, with the new polarised-light image clearly showing that the ring is magnetised.\u201cLight becomes polarised when it goes through certain filters, like the lenses of polarised sunglasses, or when it is emitted in hot regions of space that are magnetised. In the same way polarised sunglasses help us see better by reducing reflections and glare from bright surfaces, astronomers can sharpen their vision of the region around the black hole by looking at how the light originating from there is polarised. Specifically, polarisation allows astronomers to map the magnetic field lines present at the inner edge of the black hole,\u201d he said.\u201cWe are solving the mysteries of the universe here, we are discovering how the universe works. We hope that this discovery is going to motivate generations of young people, and inspire the future of the country,\u201d he added.The EHT collaboration, who produced the first ever image of a black hole, has revealed a new view of the massive object at the centre of the M87 galaxy: how it looks in polarised light. This is the first time astronomers have been able to measure polarisation, a signature of magnetic fields, this close to the edge of a black hole. The observations are key to explaining how the M87 galaxy, located 55 million light-years away, is able to launch energetic jets from its core.On 10 April 2019, scientists released the first ever image of a black hole, revealing a bright ring-like structure with a dark central region \u2014 the black hole\u2019s shadow. Since then, the EHT collaboration has delved deeper into the data on the supermassive object at the heart of the M87 galaxy collected in 2017. They have discovered that a significant fraction of the light around the M87 black hole is polarised.Dr. Juan Carlos Algaba Marcos is part of the EHT that won the 2020 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics. The Breakthrough Prize, known as the \"Oscars of Science,\" annually recognizes achievements in the Life Sciences, Fundamental Physics and Mathematics, disciplines that ask the biggest questions and seek the deepest explanations. Considered the world's most generous science prize, each Breakthrough Prize is $3 million.#UMisOne#ServingTheNation#ImpactingTheWorld"

Its budget of almost \u20ac15 billion will provide great opportunities for over 4 million Europeans to study, receive training from the best experts, gain valuable experiences and to volunteer abroad. Students aside, organizations and institutions can also participate and engage in developing networking activities to create transnational partnerships which will benefit both the organization and students though the increased capacity to operate at an international level.Preparations began in September last year when UM was approached by Mr. Richard Faint, the project leader for the internationalization of D&A, to explore the concept of \u201cWest meets East\u201d with the Department of Dance in the Cultural centre.Lee, Daniel and Richard arrived from Scotland finally on 21st March 2016 to a much warmer than expected welcome thanks to the El Nino phenomenon. Lee Lappin, the head of performing arts and Daniel Aing, a lecturer in modern contemporary dance, worked closely with the faculty members and students from the dance department during their 2 week-long stint in UM. During that time, they had the opportunity to observe and participate in Malay and classical Indian dance classes and in return, they organized workshops on modern contemporary dances and contact improvisation which provided valuable learning experience for both the students and lecturers.With the signing of an agreement between D&A and UM, two of our faculty members from the Cultural Center will have the opportunity to visit the facilities in D&A sometime in the middle of the year. The Erasmus+ program will support all expenses incurred for the exchange and the lecturers from UM will be given the opportunity introduce local dances to the college and at the same time acquire knowledge which would enrich their professional skills.The faculty members from the Dance department - Mr. Leng Poh Gee, Dr. Joelle Jacinto and Dr. Premalatha, who are actively involved in this project, voiced their appreciation of this collaboration with D&A. They believe that workshops such as the one offered by Lee and Daniel are valuable as these bring students of different levels together and allow them to explore more than what is offered in their program. They also hope that results from this collaboration can foster more support and funding for workshops and future productions.By Annie Lau Sek Yi"

Besides UM, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) were the other representative from the higher education sector.PTM Director, Dr. David Asirvatham, who was on hand to collect the awards, commended the efforts of his team, who managed to perform a minor 'miracle' as they managed to interpret 20 years of data in a short span of time using the current technology in UM.\"Using the Open Source software currently in use, we managed to analyze the data from the past 20 years within a few minutes. We didn't use any expensive software rather we only cluster computers to perform the analytics,\" he said.Deputy Vice-Chancellor of Development (DVC D), Professor Dr. Faisal Rafiq Mahamd Adikan also commented on this fantastic achievement:\"What is significant is the fact that ours were driven by PTM and not research based. We saw the importance of Big Data and began investing on it with the goal of providing top management correlations which are otherwise not available using 'small data'. Our F41s/F44s/F48s were behind this awesome, forward looking effort,\" he added."

Meanwhile, 3 of the Outstanding Delegate Award (Second Prize) goes to Victor Germain in Historic UN Security Council, Ines Cbn in UN Security Council and Shahir Islam in WHO and the Honorable Mention Award (Third Prize) goes to Tashfiah Hamid in UN Human Rights Council.Given the relatively newly created of the MUN secretariat in UM in November 2015, this was the first time that UM won the best overall institutional delegation in the local MUN competition, which is quite new among the public universities in Malaysia. The organizer of the MONMUNIC and majority of the adjudicators who had previously adjudicating and chairing various committees at the Harvard World MUN Conference (WMUN0 was generally impressed with the quality of the debate and world class performance presented by the UM team despite their new participations in the local and international MUN scenes.Currently, the newly created of the Secretariat of UMMUN is currently under the responsibility of its full-time trainer, David Rajarajman (the 2016 NTU Singapore MUN Winner) and the Head-Coach of Dr. Danial Azman, a senior lecturer at the Department of International and Strategic Studies, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, UM and Advisor of the UM International Relations Society (UMIRSoc).

Rombongan yang diiringi oleh 17 orang guru, turut disertai oleh Hj. Saiful Adli Suhadak, Pegawai Pendidikan Daerah Kuala Langat.Lawatan ini antara lainnya bertujuan untuk memberi pendedahan awal mengenai bidang kerjaya dan peluang melanjutkan pengajian di peringkat pengajian tinggi setamatnya pengajian di peringkat sekolah kelak. \u201cWalaupun mungkin ada yang merasakan pendedahan ini terlalu awal untuk murid-murid yang belum lagi menamatkan persekolahan rendah mereka, namun kami percaya usaha ini mampu menyuntik motivasi kepada mereka untuk meneruskan pelajaran dengan sungguh-sungguh di sekolah,\u201d kata Prof. Madya Dr. Rosmadi Fauzi, Yang Dipertua PIBG SK Sri Langat yang turut serta di dalam program ini.Lawatan yang julung kali diadakan oleh sekolah ini selepas pandemik COVID-19 ini juga merupakan lawatan murid sekolah yang pertama diterima oleh UM. \u201cKami amat berbesar hati menerima kunjungan mereka, kerana secara tidak langsung program ini menunjukkan universiti adalah sebahagian daripada masyarakat. Proses pembangunan anak-anak ini melalui bidang pendidikan akan memastikan kemajuan masyarakat setempat yang holistik dan menyeluruh,\u201d kata Prof. Dr. Hanafi Hussin, Dekan Fakulti Seni Kreatif UM yang menyambut kunjungan peserta program di Panggung Eksperimen.Selain Fakulti Seni Kreatif, program yang dinamai \u2018Sehari Sebagai Mahasiswa\u2019 ini turut dijayakan dengan kerjasama pelbagai unit di dalam UM, termasuklah Pusat Pemasaran dan Pengambilan (MRC), Pejabat Komunikasi Korporat, Fakulti Kejuruteraan, dan Muzium Seni Asia. Sukarelawan yang terdiri daripada mahasiswa jurusan geografi dari Fakulti Sastera dan Sains Sosial juga meluangkan masa menjadi fasilitator kepada para peserta program.Menariknya, peserta program diberi peluang menikmati jamuan tengahari di dalam Dewan Tunku Canselor (DTC). \u201cSaya difahamkan peluang sebegini amat jarang diperolehi kerana DTC dikhususkan untuk acara rasmi universiti sahaja, seperti istiadat konvokesyen. Jadi peluang yang diberikan oleh penganjur kepada kami ini pastinya akan menjadi memori yang indah kepada semua murid yang terlibat, dan menambahkan semangat mereka untuk belajar di sekolah dan menjejakkan kaki ke universiti satu hari nanti,\u201d kata En. Ruslan bin Lebai Yakub, Guru Besar SK Sri Langat, yang mengetuai kumpulan guru pengiring program.Selain ucapan aluan dari Dekan Fakulti Seni Kreatif dan pengenalan UM oleh Pengarah, Pejabat Komunikasi Korporat, aktiviti para peserta turut melibatkan lawatan ke makmal-makmal penyelidikan di Fakulti Kejuruteraan dan Muzium Seni Asia. \u201cSK Sri Langat merupakan sekolah kluster kecemerlangan STEM dan kesenian. Maka pendedahan awal kepada bidang gunaan seperti kejuruteraan dan koleksi unik di muzium ini amat membantu dalam proses pembelajaran mereka,\u201d kata En. Ruslan lagi.\u201cWalaupun program ini agak singkat dan hanya sebahagian UM sahaja yang sempat dilawati, namun saya percaya objektif program telah tercapai apabila melihat riak wajah murid-murid ini. Saya pasti keletihan yang dirasai dalam perjalanan yang jauh dari Banting telah terubat apabila menjejakkan kaki ke kampus UM buat pertama kalinya. Saya doakan mereka, guru-guru, ibu bapa, dan semua warga SK Sri Langat terus maju jaya dalam usaha mendidik dan membina sahsiah anak-anak ini,\u201d kata Prof. Dr. Hanafi Hussin mengakhiri temubual."

    "body": "SULTAN NAZRIN LAUNCHES \"CONTESTING MALAYSIA\u2019S INTEGRATION INTO THE WORLD ECONOMY\"His Royal Highness Sultan Nazrin Muizzuddin Shah, Chancellor of Universiti Malaya, officiated the book launch of \u201cContesting Malaysia\u2019s Integration into the World Economy\u201d organised by the Asia-Europe Institute, Universiti Malaya on 29th September 2022.Edited by Distinguished Professor Dato\u2019 Dr. Rajah Rasiah, Emeritus Professor Dr. Azirah Hashim and Dr. Jatswan S. Sidhu, the book brings together a set of incisive essays that interrogate Malaysian history and social relations which began during pre-colonial times, and extended to colonial and post-colonial Malaysia. In doing so, it takes the lead from the innovative historian, Professor Dato\u2019 Dr. Shaharil Talib Robert who argued that the recrafting of history should go beyond the use of conventional methodologies and analytic techniques.His Royal Highness Sultan Nazrin Muizzuddin Shah in His Royal Address said that Professor Shaharil was a highly respected and eminent Malaysian historian \u2013 a legend and luminary of Universiti Malaya \u2013 deeply respected by his peers and students alike.\u201cHis teachings and writings contributed enormously to our understanding of life in colonial Malaya, and of the Southeast Asian region more generally. As the founding Executive Director of the Asia-Europe Institute, Universiti Malaya, Professor Shaharil started new postgraduate social science courses, inspired a generation of students, and launched a very successful international student exchange programme.\u201cI am delighted to launch this commemorative multi-disciplinary book: Contesting Malaysia\u2019s Integration into the World Economy, dedicated to the memory and works of Professor Shaharil. The collection of essays is enriching, challenging, and a thought-provoking interrogation of Malaysian history and social relations before, during, and after the colonial era.\u201cIt addresses the role of economic factors, and the participation of local actors in shaping a wide range of socioeconomics and political processes. In all of the chapters we find accepted versions of the truth being questioned. We find carefully considered new evidence being applied to existing orthodoxies, or to hitherto unexplored aspects of our past and present. There is even a questioning and extension of Shaharil\u2019s own work on the Malay aristocracy \u2013 which he no doubt would have welcomed.\u201dDistinguished Professor Dato\u2019 Dr. Rajah Rasiah, the Executive Director of the Asia-Europe Institute said that Malaysia has produced outstanding historians in the past, and a number of them studied and undertook their early research at Universiti Malaya. The late Professor Dato\u2019 Shaharil Talib Robert comes from that tradition whose focus on interrogation to review historical developments from a diversity of angles before historical judgments are made is quite well known.\u201cHe is the type who would have easily met E.H. Carr\u2019s mold that historians should tell the real story of what had happened, including their causes, rather than just conjecturing on what is rational.\u201cThe book provides a fitting tribute to the life and work of the late Professor Shaharil Talib Robert in the depth and richness of the scholarship that it brings together, as well as in its range and scope. It embodies Professor Shaharil\u2019s concept of history as being actively constructed through the critical interrogation of existing perspectives and robust use of evidence.\u201cThis approach is what we see on display here in all the individual contributions. The broader question the book addresses - of the intersection of the national, regional and global scales - also lay right at the heart of his work,\u201d he said."

Dr. Abdul Aziz Abdul Raman, a Professor from Faculty of Engineering which is also the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Development), UM said that it was a great honour to be named to the list as this signifies another significant milestone for UM.\u201cI joined academia 20 years ago and built up advanced wastewater treatment as my main research area together with various areas that I am working on. My research focuses on developing advanced wastewater treatments that are cheaper and lower carbon footprint, all this development can contribute significantly to the industries.\u201cI have been developing wastewater treatment systems for small and medium industries. Therefore, it can be an affordable technology for small and medium industries. And we can increase compliances and reduce pollution from wastewaters,\u201d he added.Professor\u00a0\u202aNasrudin Abd Rahim from UM Power Energy Dedicated Advanced Centre (UMPEDAC) said that research is a long and challenging journey, but the abilities to survive in science and technology can be learned.\u201cMy research journey started when I did my PhD under Prof Barry Williams's supervision, working in Power Electronics for energy conversion. I was fascinated by how electrical energy can be shaped and controlled to improve the overall performance of energy systems.\u201cEnergy has always been the fuel for development in human civilization. The technologies that I am developing with my UMPEDAC team are dedicated to improving and maximizing the generated energy and efficiencies to be deployed. We are concerned with energy poverty issues such as unfortunate communities that do not have convenient electricity access. Through collaborations with Kyoto University in Japan, we are interested in providing practical rural electrification in South East Asia.\u201cI hope all these efforts will benefit our nation and beyond,\u201d he added.Professor Md. Abul Kalam from Faculty of Engineering, UM said that\u00a0as a mechanical engineer, He has chosen this research field because it is related to the department's core subjects such as thermodynamic, fluid mechanics, heat transfer, solid mechanics, materials characteristics.\u201cThe study on alternative fuels has a significant impact on society, especially on biofuel production and utilization in IC engines. Biodiesel is an alternative fuel, which is a domestic and renewable resource. And this biodiesel production and utilization are related to all kinds of academic knowledge, farmer knowledge, land cultivation, and industrially related.

Di peringkat UM, projek ini merupakan satu tanggungjawab sosial korporat (CSR) dengan menawarkan tenaga pengajar mahir dari aspek lakonan, gubahan lagu, koreografi, skrip, pengarahan dan kemudahan studio serta panggung untuk pementasan ini.Seramai 33 orang murid berusia antara 8 \u2013 12 tahun yang memainkan peranan sebagai pelakon, penari, korus, pemuzik dan \u2018choral speaking\u2019 terlibat dalam pementasan ini.Pementasan teater \u201cJasa Putera\u201d yang berlangsung selama tiga hari dari 6 - 8 November 2015 adalah bertemakan semangat menimba ilmu, cintakan negara dan hidup bermasyarakat selain diilhamkan daripada pementasan Muzikal \u2018The King & I\u2019 yang menceritakan seorang raja Siam pada abad ke-18 yang inginkan kemajuan untuk rakyat jelatanya melalui cara menimba ilmu terutamanya Bahasa Inggeris yang dianggap bahasa moden dan saintifik.Teater yang julung-julung kali dianjurkan ini juga merupakan sebahagian program \u2018outreach\u2019 Pusat Kebudayaan UM bagi mendekati masyarakat dengan berkongsi kepakaran yang dimiliki pihak universiti.PLOTPementasan muzikal ini memaparkan latar zaman Kesultanan Melayu awal abad ke-19 di mana pada ketika itu penduduk Malaya telah terbentuk masyarakat yang majmuk. Baginda Sultan ketika itu seorang pemerintah yang amat disayangi dan disanjungi rakyat jelata. Apabila tiba masa untuk putera baginda melanjutkan pelajaran ke England, baginda berasa sangat prihatin tentang nasib rakyat baginda yang begitu setia namun masih ramai yang tidak berpeluang mendapat pendidikan moden yang sewajarnya.Menyedari hakikat ini, baginda berusaha mendapatkan beberapa orang cendekiawan dari England untuk mendidik rakyatnya dalam mata pelajaran Bahasa Inggeris, Sains dan Matematik. Sudah pasti pendidik-pendidik jemputan ini pada awalnya perlu menyesuaikan diri dengan adat-adat serta kebudayaan pelbagai kaum, pelbagai jenis binatang, serangga dan jenis makanan yang berbeza, selain cuaca yang panas berbanding negara asal mereka.Antara cabaran yang dihadapi baginda adalah sesetengah ibubapa yang terlalu mementingkan cara hidup lama dan tidak mahu menerima pembaharuan. Mereka tidak membenarkan anak mereka mengikuti program yang dinaungi baginda. Dalam memperlihatkan sifat merendah diri, baginda sanggup pergi ke rumah rakan-rakan berjumpa ibubapa ini dan memberi penerangan lebih lanjut. Ibubapa berkenaan terharu dengan usaha dan kesungguhan baginda dan akhirnya menyedari betapa pentingnya ilmu kepada anak-anak mereka.Setelah beberapa tahun program ini berlangsung, rakyat jelata dilihat lebih berpelajaran, bertutur dan menyanyi berkenaan sains dan matematik di dalam Bahasa Inggeris sementara pendidik-pendidik dari luar negara sudah dapat bertutur dan menyanyi di dalam Bahasa Melayu tentang pengalaman manis mereka di Malaya. Mereka juga lebih selesa memakai baju kurung, baju melayu, kurta, cheongsam dan sebagainya.Dengan kejayaan program ini yang sangat memberangsangkan, baginda bertitah bahawa akan terus mengembangkan program pembelajaran ini tetapi sentiasa mengingatkan rakyat agar tidak sekali-kali mengenepikan tradisi dan adat masing-masing. Ringkasnya, baginda mahukan rakyat supaya sentiasa bersedia menerima perubahan ke arah kebaikan selari dengan perkembangan dunia tanpa melupakan nilai-nilai mulia yang dipegang sejak turun-temurun walau di mana sahaja mereka berada.Kecil tapi berbakatKetibaan Tuanku ZaraKetibaan Tuanku ZaraPelajar SK Sri Petaling memulakan persembahanTuanku Zara bersalam dengan pelajar sebelum berangkat pulangUcapan aluan oleh Pengarah Pusat Kebudayaan"

    "body": "On 13 April 2019, Duli Yang Maha Mulia Raja Permaisuri Perak Darul Ridzuan Tuanku Zara Salim launched myKidney 2019 today in Kompleks Perdana Siswa, University of Malaya (UM).With the tagline \u201cBe Someone\u2019s Reason To Be Alive\u201d, myKidney project aims to develop talent and strengthen their knowledge in kidney transplantation, thus increasing the number of kidney transplant in the country. A 'Transplantation Research Centre' network will be created in stages and will be the backbone of Research & Development in the area of kidney transplant in Malaysia.The 24th Report of the Malaysian Dialysis & Transplant Registry 2016 stated that there were 37,183 patients receiving dialysis, a 2.5-fold increase as compared to the last decade. Despite the rapid increase in dialysis population, the number of kidney transplantation performed in patients had remained very low, with not more than 100 cases per annum for the past years. As of October 2018, there were 25,000 kidney patients in Malaysia who are still waiting to undergo kidney transplant procedures.\u201cmyKidney is an integrated Corporate Social Responsibility project under the CEO@Faculty Programme 2.0, Ministry of Education Malaysia, established to organize efforts from interested stakeholders towards a concerted approach for patients with chronic kidney disease\u201d, said Associate Professor Dr. Ivy Chung, Director of myKidney Launch and Fun Run 2019.myKidney project was initiated in early 2018 when Dr. Ivy was doing a 6-month industrial attachment in healthcare industry. She realised the number of kidney patients in Malaysia increases by about 1,000 every year. Together with the Industry Relations Division, she is called upon to set up a platform that allows various ministries, industry partners and relevant agencies to discuss and find solutions for this societal issue.Dr. Rafidah Abdullah, Consultant Nephrologist and Head of Department at Hospital Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah, Temerloh, Pahang highlights that \u201cChronic kidney disease may eventually result in complete kidney failure. When the kidneys totally fail, either dialysis or a kidney transplant is required. Dialysis does not cure end-stage renal disease. A transplant offers the closest thing to a normal life because the transplanted kidney can replace the failed kidneys\u201d.Professor Dr Arham Abdullah, Director of Industry Relations Division, Ministry of Education Malaysia, explains that myKidney project will be an example of how critical social issues such as inadequate kidney transplant in our country can be dealt with integrated collaboration.\u201cKnowledge alone is inadequate, even the spirit of empathy and strengthening the powerful collaboration can reduce the gap among the parties with its own direction. Such an effort is compatible with our public education philosophy, and as such, it is desirable to officially launch myKidney project\u201d, he added.Earlier before the launching, myKidney Fun Run was flagged off with more than 500 participation from the public. Fund raised from this run will be channeled to a Patient Welfare Account at University of Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) and will be used to assist underprivileged chronic kidney disease patients who require a kidney transplant.During the launching, the queen who was also the Patron of myKidney has visited the health exhibition. Health screening, Organ Donation campaign, advocacy sesssions, cooking demostartion by Dato' Fazley Yaakob and performance by Imran Ajmain were among the activiites held during the launching."

    "body": "Dr. Juan Carlos Algaba Marcos from the Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Universiti Malaya is part of the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHT) that won the 2020 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics.The Breakthrough Prize, known as the \"Oscars of Science,\" annually recognizes achievements in the Life Sciences, Fundamental Physics and Mathematics, disciplines that ask the biggest questions and seek the deepest explanations. Considered the world's most generous science prize, each Breakthrough Prize is $3 million.Dr. Juan first involved with the collaboration when he moved to Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA) where he joined the team involved in deploying a telescope in Greenland that could eventually be used for the EHT. His background research includes the knowledge of Very Long Baseline Interferometry, a type of astronomical interferometry used in radio astronomy. This is the same technique used with the Event Horizon Telescope, combining different radio-telescopes around the world to observe the black hole.The senior lecturer hailing from Spain obtained his PhD in University College Cork, Ireland. He then went on to ASIAA in Taiwan for four years, and later to Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute and Seoul National University for another four years. His specialty is the study with radio waves of Active Galactic Nuclei (galaxies with a supermassive black hole in the center producing very energetic phenomena).Sharing his experience working with the team, he said that it was a very challenging undertaking, as the work involved observations in very remote locations, and of actual data analysis.\u201cFrom the scientific point of view, since I am studying phenomena in galaxies powered by black holes, it is clear that I wish to investigate the central engine powering it. Thus, when I moved to ASIAA, it was very straightforward to join the collaboration,\u201d Dr. Juan said.\u201cThe plan was divided in various sections. One of them involved the Greenland telescope project. Another part included more direct work and collaboration with what would eventually become the EHT consortium. This allowed us to do some observations and data analysis, and consider all the logistics and technical challenges. Finally, we also worked hard on the science nearby the black hole, which was necessary to understand the image that we would later obtain.However, it is also very gratifying to be part of such a big project. Even though black holes have been theoreticised for several decades, they have mostly remained in the realm of science fiction, and it is a great privilege to be part of the team who is able to reveal them for the first time,\u201d he added.Looking forward to the future, Dr. Juan said that the image of the super massive black hole in M87 is just the first step. There are other targets that EHT is also aiming for, including Sagittarius A* (pronounced \"Sagittarius A-Star\"), and the black hole in our own galaxy, the Milky Way. There are also multiple campaigns to observe these black holes several more times, so that the team can obtain not only a picture, but also a movie with dynamical characteristics that can be studied.UM will also has a bigger involvement with EHT. According to Dr. Juan, Associate Professor Dr. Zamri Zainal Abidin from the Department of Physics has been leading the effort to obtain memorandum of agreement with the East Asian Observatory, which is key for further collaboration with EHT.Dr. Juan will share the $3 million prize equally with 347 scientists co-authoring any of the six papers published by the EHT on April 10, 2019. According to Harvard & Smithsonian, EHT are eight high-powered radio telescopes strategically positioned in Antarctica, Chile, Mexico, Hawaii and the continental United States, a global collaboration of 348 astrophysicists at 60 institutions in 20 countries photographed a black hole for the first time, targeting the supermassive black hole at the center of the Messier 87 galaxy \u2013 its mass equivalent to 3.5 billion suns. After synchronizing their snapshots to within a fraction of a trillionth of a second, and painstakingly analyzing the data with novel imaging techniques, the team produced a composite image of this galactic monster silhouetted against a blurry ring of light that had escaped its pull."

    "title": "UM EXPERT AT THE FOREFRONT IN CALL FOR GLOBAL DRUG POLICY REFORM",
    "body": "HIV & AIDS champion and Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Professor Dr. Adeeba Kamarulzaman together with experts from the Johns Hopkins-Lancet Commission on Drug Policy and Health, launched the Commission\u2019s report on drug policies and the call for a global drug policy reform in a press event in New York City on 24 March 2016. It was held ahead of the United Nations General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) on 19th April \u2013 the first UNGASS meeting on drugs since 1998.Authors of the Johns Hopkins-Lancet Commission on Drug Policy and Health, which include Dr. Adeeba, called for non-violent minor drug offenses including use, possession and petty sale, to be decriminalized. The Commission urged countries to do away with the harsh punishment meted out at \u2018minor\u2019 drug offences and consider other more holistic ways in dealing with the scourge of drug abuse worldwide.The Commission\u2019s study showed that fifty years of drug policies which restricted and criminalized drug use have had serious detrimental effects on health, well-being and human rights of drug users and the wider public. It also found that the biggest contributing factor to higher rates of infectious diseases among drug users is the excessive use of incarceration and the systematic exclusion of drug users from HIV and hepatitis C prevention services (e.g. needle exchange) and treatment (e.g. opioid substitution therapy) \u2013 whether in the community or in prison. Indeed, new analysis by the Commission found that harsher prison sentences are also associated with higher rates of hepatitis C infection among injecting drug users. This stands in stark contrast with the past 30 years of progress made in reducing sexual transmissions of HIV.\u201cApproximately 11% of people who used illicit drugs worldwide are classed as problematic drug users. But the idea that all drug use is necessarily \u2018abuse\u2019 means that immediate and complete abstinence has been seen as the only acceptable approach,\u201d said Dr. Adeeba.\u201cIn countries and regions where opiate substitution therapy remain unavailable or at not provided to scale HIV and HCV epidemics continue to expand. Furthermore, continued criminalization of drug use fuels HIV, HCV and TB transmission within prisons and the community at large.\u201cThere is another way. Programs and policies aimed at reducing harm should be central to future drug policies,\u201d she added.The Commission has reviewed the global evidence based on the health impacts of drug policy. The report provides compelling evidence from countries such as Portugal and the Czech Republic that have modified or rejected the prohibitionist approach to drug policy, and as a result, these countries have seen significant public health benefits, cost savings, and lower incarceration with no significant increase in problematic drug use.Note to editor.This article has been modified from the statement released by The Johns Hopkins-Lancet Commission on Drug Policy and Health.The original version can be accessed via:http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/XXX/abstractBy Harris Rajahdin."

    "body": "The Social Wellbeing Research Centre (SWRC) is pleased to announce the findings of the Malaysia Ageing and Retirement Survey (MARS) Wave 2, conducted to comprehensively understand the evolving landscape of aging and retirement in Malaysia. This nationwide longitudinal study has provided valuable insights into the lives of individuals aged 40 years and older, shedding light on various socio-economic aspects, health, family dynamics, and societal factors.The MARS Wave 2 survey built upon the foundation of Wave 1, which successfully interviewed 5,613 respondents in 2019. In its current iteration, Wave 2 revisited the original respondents while introducing face-to-face interviews with approximately 1,000 new households. Data collection for Wave 2 spanned from October 2020 to April 2022, resulting in participation from a total of 4,821 respondents. Among these, an encouraging 75% were returning participants from the previous wave.MARS has meticulously gathered information on critical issues impacting middle-aged and elderly adults, encompassing socioeconomic and demographic attributes, family dynamics, healthcare access, economic security, and other pertinent social variables. The survey paints a comprehensive picture of the Malaysian aging population, revealing trends and challenges that have emerged since the previous wave.Key findings from the MARS Wave 2 survey include:The average age of respondents was 58 years, with individuals aged 60 years and older comprising 44% of the sample.The majority of respondents identified as Malays, were married, and held at least a lower secondary education level.Multigenerational households were common, though approximately 5% of respondents lived alone.Active intergenerational financial exchanges were observed, both between respondents and their children, as well as between respondents and their parents and/or parents-in-law.While 45% of respondents were still engaged in work, there were notable gender disparities, with 62% of males and 32% of females reporting employment. A significant portion were self-employed.Approximately 60% of respondents reported at least one doctor-diagnosed disease, with hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes being the most prevalent.Over 80% of respondents maintained a positive outlook on life, valuing family, friends, and a sense of purpose.Respondents expressed a reluctance to opt for assisted living facilities, while favouring government-mandated care for aging parents.The pandemic significantly impacted economic, family, and social aspects of respondents' lives, with financial effects being more pronounced among males, females, and younger age groups.The MARS Wave 2 survey report provides an insightful snapshot of the evolving landscape of aging and retirement in Malaysia. These findings hold significance for policymakers, researchers, and organizations working toward better understanding and addressing the needs of the aging population."

    "body": "KUALA LUMPUR, 2 NOVEMBER 2021- Universiti Malaya (UM) has been ranked 8th in the Quacquarelli-Symonds (QS) University Rankings: Asia (QS-AUR) 2022, ascending one place from last year. This unprecedented achievement sees UM improving on last year\u2019s ground-breaking feat of breaking into the top 10 Asian universities for the first time since the inauguration of the QS-AUR in 2009. UM has consistently improved its performance by over 30 places over the last 11 consecutive years. UM remains the nation\u2019s best in its overall position and 3rd among ASEAN universities. According to QS, UM is placed within the top 2% of the 687 Asian universities ranked in QS-AUR 2022.UM tops Asia\u2019s universities for the international research network indicator for the 3rd successive year. Among the remaining indicators, UM registered improvements in employer reputation, academic reputation, and staff with PhD. Areas requiring attention include inbound exchange students, outbound exchange students, international students, international faculty, citations per paper, faculty-student, and papers per faculty. Nationally, UM is placed first among the 36 Malaysian universities ranked in QS-AUR 2022 in the academic reputation, employer reputation, citations per paper, and international research network indicators.According to Dato\u2019 Professor Ir. Dr. Mohd Hamdi Abd Shukor, Vice-Chancellor, UM is seeking to explore other global options for research collaboration that will contribute to stronger global impact.\u201cWe are planning to venture to the African and Latin America region where there are many opportunities for research collaboration such as infectious disease, poverty and development studies as well as capacity building. We have already established the UM North-South Research Centre (UMNSRC). UMNSRC is a research centre focusing on comparative studies regarding economic, political, social and cultural issues around the world. There are four centres under UMNSRC, two of which are the Centre of Latin American Studies (CLAS) and Africa-Asia Development University Network (AADUN).\u201cThe centres work hard to conduct research projects and organise activities to strengthen Malaysia's bilateral relationship with the respective partner countries. Therefore, I think that we are on the right track in placing the foundation for these ventures,\u201d he said.Another exciting capacity building initiative is the Erasmus+ Building Social Research Capacities in Higher Education Institutions (BRECIL) led by UM. The project had as its main objective to develop human capital and facilitate individual learning and institutional mechanisms in Social Science research in higher education institutions in Lao PDR and Malaysia.\u201cIt was envisaged that at the end of the project, Lao PDR research capacity will be enhanced and that the project will have contributed to greater intra ASEAN mobility among the higher education community. The impact of this project will be significant and I am proud that UM is contributing to the region.\u201cIn tandem with our tagline, \u201cServing the Nation, Impacting the World\u201d, we are actively involved in global networks and associations such as the Presidents\u2019 Forum of Southeast Asia and Taiwan Universities (SATU Presidents\u2019 Forum), Association of Pacific Rim Universities (APRU), ASEAN University Network (AUN), and Asian Universities Alliance (AUA) of which we hold the Executive Presidency for the 2021-2022 term.\u201cWe are also proud that this year, Dato' Prof. Dr. Adeeba Kamarulzaman from the Faculty of Medicine, has been appointed as a member of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Science Council, \u00a0a high-level Scientific Advisory Group that will act as the voice of scientific leadership and will advise on advances in science and technology that could directly impact global health.\u201dEven as UM pursues its relentless bid to serve the nation against the Covid-19 pandemic, it manages to rise above the pandemic and continues to maintain its education and research quality.\u201cThis is remarkable when you realize that the Universiti Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) is one of the Covid-19 treatment centres while on campus, we hosted one of the nation\u2019s vaccination centres (PPV). Adding to that, the Tropical Infectious Diseases Research & Education Centre (TIDREC) was appointed as one of the assessment bodies in performing the evaluation of COVID-19 diagnostics test kits,\u201d Dato\u2019 Hamdi said.\u201cOur challenges for the past two years include navigating and adapting to the new normal, international student and staff recruitment, student mobility, research funding, and movement restriction. Despite these challenges, we are blessed with a steep talent-pool, dedicated staff and effective strategic plan.\u201cI am deeply grateful for the support from our Chancellor, Pro-Chancellors and Board of Directors. \u00a0My sincerest appreciation especially to Yang Berhormat Datuk Seri Dr. Noraini Ahmad, Minister of Higher Education for her unwavering support and leadership. I would also like to thank the University community \u2013 our staff and students for their commitment and dedication towards the achievement of the university\u2019s performance in the QS-AUR 2022.\u201cWe are committed to continue providing world-class education and quality research in line with our pursuit to be a global university impacting the world,\u201d he added.#UMPassion#ServingTheNation#ImpactingTheWorld"

    "title": "UM RESEARCHERS AND PERSATUAN MENINGGIKAN AKHLAK CHE THAI KHOR LABIS JOHOR CONDUCT RESEARCH ON WATER QUALITY STATUS IN 6 SELECTED WATER SOURCES AROUND LABIS",
    "body": "In 2006, the Labis River was subjected to a serious aluminium dross dumping, which led to negative environmental and social impacts. Over 300 residents of Kampung Sungai Gatom evacuated their homes due to the emission of ammonia fumes produced from the waste. Six schools, namely SK Labis, SK Sri Labis, Sekolah Agama Labis, SMK Jalan Muar, SMK Labis and SJK(T) Labis, were afffected due to this incident. The closure of these schools had affected more than 3,000 students. The incident was widely reported in the media at the time.Little information was available about the change of aluminium dross level in environmental matrices and the long-term effect of this pollution incident on human health, aquatic ecosystem as well as the quality of the nearby water sources. For this reason, UM and Persatuan Meninggikan Akhlak Che Thai Khor Labis Johor have formed a partnership to\u00a0 analyse the water quality status of the surface water at the selected sampling points within the Labis area that were affected by the aluminium dross dumping in 2006.According to Dr. Fathiah Mohamed Zuki, Faculty of Engineering Universiti Malaya, the partnership began in 2019 - in which UM provided expertise in water sampling analysis while Persatuan Meninggikan Akhlak Che Thai Khor Labis Johor provided funding and logistical support. Water samples from six selected water sources around Labis was taken from the upstream (Juaseh dam) to the downstream area: Sungai Juaseh, Sungai Gatom, Intersection of Sungai Gatom-Sungai Labis, Sungai Labis, and the water from a selected well.\u201cThe water quality parameters measured in this survey includes the Water Quality Index parameters, namely the Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Suspended Solid (TSS), pH, and Ammoniacal Nitrogen (AN).\u00a0 In addition, turbidity, bacteria, nutrients, and heavy metal contents have also been analysed. Based on the standard Water Quality Index (WQI), the selected locations are registering WQI in\u00a0 Class 2 and 3 categories,\u201d she said.\u201cIn general, the results indicated that the concentration values of the measured parameters are in the acceptable range. Physical and biological parameters have also presented satisfying values. The results also indicated that some chemical parameters, such as BOD, COD, and pH do have high concentrations at certain locations and needs to be periodically monitored.\u201cAll six sample locations have aluminium content lower than the standard limit of 0.06 mg/L. This \u00a0provides some \u00a0indication that the long-term impact \u00a0\u00a0from past aluminium dross dumping in the area is rather negligible.\u00a0 Nevertheless, periodical samplings and analysis can be helpful to ascertain this issue,\u201d Profesor Ir. Dr. Faridah Othman, Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Malaya said.Relatively high concentrations of phosphorus, copper, and manganese were found at some locations; \u00a0namely Sg. Labis, Sg. Juaseh,\u00a0 Sg. Gatoms, and the well water. However, based on the national water quality standards, these concentrations level is not critical and can be removed with proper treatment methods.The findings were also summarized in the map below. The \u201cmini heart shape\u201d icons in the map represents the water quality of the sampled water sources within the Labis area, based on the Eco-Heart Index. This is an index that has been produced by UM researchers (UM Water Warriors) that uses the heart shape (full or broken) as symbolic representation of water quality scientific data. This provides a simpler data visualisation and communication for the community.Eco Heart Index represent the water quality conditions of various water resources in Labis area (Empangan Juaseh, Suangai Juaseh, Sungai Labis, Sungai Gatom and the intersection).Findings from the study has led to the following recommendations for the community of Labis:The community is advised not to consume water directly from the river and the well water due to the relatively high COD, BOD, and some metal contents. However, the non-potable usage such as cleaning, watering, and planting purposes may be utilised.In order to enhance the long-term quality of water resources in Labis, periodic testing and monitoring can be conducted by the community with support from relevant partners. For instance, a partner like UM can further collaborate with Persatuan Meninggikan Akhlak Che Thai Khor to initiate a citizen science-based monitoring programme to promote both community and stakeholder participation in water quality monitoring and to increase awareness on water conservation.The UM\u2019s research team is led by Dr. Fathiah Mohamed Zuki and supported by Prof. Ir. Dr. Faridah Othman, Associate Prof. Dr. Ng Boon Kwee and Associate Prof. Dr. Zeeda Fatimah. This project is an example of UM\u2019s commitment in supporting local community, especially in the spirit of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). More specifically, it exhibits how researchers in Faculty of Engineering and Faculty of Science, UM able reach out to local community in forging a more impactful and meaningful university-community collaboration in localising SDG6 (Clean water and sanitation), SDG 3 (Good health and wellbeing) and SDG 11 (Sustainable cities and communities)"

Jadi abu tersebut merebak dan naik ke udara dan dibawa angin hingga ke India dan juga lautan India.\u201cAbu kebanyakkannya ditemui di lembangan sungai tanah tinggi yang sempit dengan tanah tinggi di sekitarnya, seperti lembangan Padang Terap dan Lembah Lenggong, disebabkan oleh lapisan abu yang terkumpul di persekitaran ini adalah tebal, lembah sungai telah menerima sumbangan abu yang banyak dari tanah tinggi sekitarnya,\u201d kata Dr. Nur Iskandar Taib, Pensyarah Sambilan, Jabatan Geologi, Fakulti Sains Universiti Malaya.Labu Sayong merupakan kraftangan tembikar tradisional yang berasal dari kampung kepala bendang, sayong yang terletak lebih kurang 10KM dari Kuala Kangsar, Perak. Ia diperbuat daripada bahan tanah liat yang mengandungi debu gunung berapi yang dipercayai dari gunung berapi Toba di Sematera.Menurut Dr. Hendrik Metselaar, Profesor Madya Jabatan Kejuruteraan Mekanikal, Fakulti Kejuruteraan Universiti Malaya, dalam penyelidikan ini, kami telah mengkaji fasa mineral yang terdapat dalam bahan mentah yang digunakan dalam pembuatan tempatan seramik Labu Sayong dan bagaimana ia berubah apabila dirawat pada suhu 1000 c. Tiga bahan tambah digunakan secara berasingan untuk mengkaji pengaruhnya terdapat sigat fizikimia dan implikasinya terhadap tingkah lalu pensinteran dan termal.\u201cAbu gunung berapi boleh memainkan peranan dalam memastikan proses pembakaran yang sempurna dan penyejatan yang baik. Bahan tanah liat dan kompenenya selepas pengapian memainkan peranan yang penting dalam memperolehi sifat mekanikal yang dikehendaki. Selain itu, bagi seramik labu sayong, kajian menyeluruh diperlukan bagi mengekalkan nilai estetik, terutama pada warna, pada masa yang sama tidak mempengaruhi tindakan sebagai pendingin bersejat dan perawatan air semulajadi,\u201d katanya."

Along with the increasing number of elder people, one must acknowledge that the elderly may no longer be able to look after themselves, losing the ability to live independently because of limited mobility, frailty or other physical or mental health problems.Realising that being independent gives the elders a sense of control over their own well-being while some need assistance due to physical or mental limitations due to aging processes, Prof. Dr. Noor Hayaty Abu Kasim and her team, with the help of Assoc. Professor Chan Chee Seng from the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology are working on a device to assist the elderly to live independently or at with the least supervision. The assistive device could maintain true levels of independence and thus empowering independent living.She shared her research entitled \u201cAssistive Device Technology for Independent Living and Active Ageing\u201d at the closing ceremony of the third holder of the Dr. Siti Hasmah Mohd Ali Chair on 8 December 2018 here at the Institute of Research Management & Monitoring (IPPP), University of Malaya (UM).

This includes a significant number of people travelling for tourism as well as educational exchanges.Professor Micheal Hsiao, Chairman of Taiwan-Asia Exchange Foundation (TAEF) and Chairman of the Center for Southeast Asian Studies at National Chengchi University commented that \u201cthe NSP is a deliberate policy to change Taiwan\u2019s identity and is not just a revision of economic policy.\u201d This means a mobilization of not just businesses but administrative agencies as well as civil societies to build better relations with its ASEAN partners.All of these positive outcomes are also evident in the relationship with South Korea. For South Korea, although there is a shift from the former President\u2019s New Southern Policy, the launch of the Korea ASEAN Strategic Initiative (KASI) as a major initiative under its Indo Pacific Strategy means South Korea continues to put priority on the continued improvement of its strategic exchanges.In both situations the Southeast Asian region is in a beneficial position to grab the opportunities presented in order to deepen its influence beyond being a passive recipient of foreign investment and market destination.The event concluded with a hybrid panel discussion session with the authors of the upcoming book \u201cSouthward Bound: Examining the Regional Policies of Taiwan and South Korea\u201d to be published by Routledge."

As before, updates were presented by UM Parkinson's Neurologists Professor Dr. Lim Shen-Yang and Dr. Tan Ai Huey on the latest advances in the field, and also specifically how research at UM has helped to advance our understanding of PD. This was followed by a research update by UM geneticist Dr. Azlina Ahmad Annuar and a \u201cDance with Parkinson\u201d session by dance therapist Mr. Mike Voon. A panel of patients, caregivers, and PD experts also came together onstage to share their experiences in a session titled \u201cThe Journey Together\u201d. These sessions were well-received and provided useful insights into the care and wellbeing of patients with Parkinson\u2019s and related disorders.The event this year was especially meaningful for two additional reasons. First, 2017 marks 200 years since PD was first characterized in detail by the English physician Dr. James Parkinson. Second, a ceremonial ground-breaking for a dedicated PD Centre at UM was held in conjunction with this event. The establishment of this Centre has been made possible by generous donations from the Dato' Tan Chin Nam Foundation (RM5 million, towards a building) and the Dato' Seri Mah Pooi Soo Benevolent Fund (RM4 million, to help fund the clinical and research activities of the PD team). The Dean of Faculty of Medicine UM, Dato\u2019 Professor Dr. Adeeba Kamarulzaman and the Hospital Deputy Director (Clinical) of UMMC, Associate Professor Dr. Nazirah Hasnan, in both their speeches, expressed utmost appreciation to the Donors and emphasized the importance of philanthropic contributions to the growth of the University and Hospital. Dato\u2019 Tan Chin Nam together with his daughter Ms. Tan Lei Cheng were present to perform the ceremonial ground breaking, witnessed by members of the Board of Trustees for the PD Centre chaired by Professor Dato\u2019 Dr. Tan Chong Tin and other University and Hospital leaders."

    "title": "UNIVERSITI MALAYA SETS UP NEW DIGITAL HEALTH SERVICE  FOR PATIENTS WITH MOUTH LESIONS",
    "body": "KUALA LUMPUR, 10thNovember 2021\u2013 Faculty of Dentistry in Universiti Malaya, in collaboration with Cancer Research Malaysia, has launched a new service using a Web App for follow up of patients and for early detection of oral cancer. There is particular urgency around early detection of oral cancer in South and Southeast Asia, which [due to local risk habits of tobacco, areca nut, and alcohol] accounts for more than 60 percent of oral cancer globally.Moreover, about 70 percent of oral cancer is diagnosed at advanced stage III and IV lowering the possibility of cure to less than 20 percent, while the diagnosis of oral cancer at an early stage can improve the cure rate to about 80 percent.Oral cancer can often present as an ulcer that doesn\u2019t heal or a loose tooth, and when patients have these symptoms, they sometimes seek advice in dental or general practitioner clinics.\u00a0 Unfortunately, these are often assumed to be innocent and that they will heal on their own. The lack of expertise to accurately diagnose oral cancer at its early stages leads to delays in diagnosis and sometimes, this delay can result in patients succumbing to their disease.Because the oral lesions are visible by a mouth examination, studies have shown that training healthcare workers to distinguish suspicious lesions from benign ones can lead to a 30% improvement in survival. But patients need to be checked and managed regularly, something that many patients find difficult to to do, because they live far away from treatment centres or require help to get to the hospital, and this has been made worse by the pandemic.Professor Dr. Cheong Sok Ching, lead developer of the MeMoSA\u00aeweb App shared, \u201cMeMoSA\u00aeallows the patient to easily document their oral lesions at home through a mobile phone camera and to send the images to their clinicians for consultation. Our study showed that the concordance between direct clinical examination and remote mobile phone detection was more than 90%, which means that signs of cancer can be identified remotely using photos taken by a smartphone. By facilitating a seamless and secure two-way communication between patients and their doctors, we have improved clinical follow up and enabled early detection of oral cancer.\u201dAssociate Professor Dr. Siti Mazlipah Ismail, oral maxillofacial surgeon at the Universiti Malaya added, \u201cDuring the pandemic, more than 60% of our patients missed or had their clinical appointments postponed. In a way, it forced us to adopt digital health technology faster and we are delighted that MeMoSA\u00aewas quickly available to enable continued care of patients.\u201dAn anonymous patient shared, \u201cThe quality of care delivered by teleconsultation is better compared to clinical visits as I was able to highlight the lesion and discuss my concerns in private, which made me feel closer to my clinicians than I would at the clinic. A plus point is that it is efficient as it saves on travelling time.\u201dToh Puan Dato\u2019 Seri Hajjah Dr. Aishah Ong who launched the new digital health services said \u201cI am delighted that Universiti Malaya and Cancer Research Malaysia have once again worked together to improve the outcome of oral cancer patients. \u00a0Oral cancer is a disease that is more common in the Asian population and integrating digital health\u00a0tools such as MeMoSA\u00aecan go a long way to improve the follow up and outcome for oral cancer patients. \u00a0We hope that donors will continue to support our efforts to save lives particularly for Asians.\"The development of MeMoSA\u00aewas made possible with the support of Yayasan Sime Darby, Yayasan PETRONAS, Vistage and partner companies, Berjaya Cares Foundation and the Medical Research Council Global Challenge Research Grant. The clinical concordance study was co-led by Professor Cheong Sok Ching\u00a0(Head, Digital Health Research Unit, Cancer Research Malaysia), and Associate Professor Dr. Siti Mazlipah Ismail (Consultant, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Universiti Malaya).For more information on the MeMoSA, check outwww.cancerresearch.myor email memosa@cancerresearch.my.

    "body": "Universiti Malaya (UM) and Yale University have been awarded a multi-million grant to establish a research and training centre on HIV implementation science through the Fogarty International Programme at the National Institutes of Health. From the overall grant, UM is receiving RM1.5 million.This programme, designed to train the next generation of implementation science researchers, builds on 15 years of research collaboration between the two universities to address critical issues at the interface of HIV, viral hepatitis, tuberculosis and addiction. This will be the second Fogarty International training programme at the Faculty of Medicine, UM, having established a Masters in Research Ethics together with the Johns Hopkins University two years ago.The Malaysian Implementation Science Training (MIST) programme will be co-directed by Frederick L. Altice, a professor of medicine and public health at Yale, and Dato\u2019 Professor Dr. Adeeba Kamarulzaman, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at UM. Professor Altice has been a Visiting Professor and Academic Icon at UM for many years, whilst Dato\u2019 Professor Dr. Adeeba Kamarulzaman has an appointment as an Adjunct Associate Professor at Yale University. Adeeba and Altice have had a long and successful history of collaboration in Malaysia on prevention and treatment of HIV, especially amongst vulnerable populations like men who have sex with men, prisoners, people who inject drugs, transgender women and sex workers. Their very successful and productive collaboration has resulted in multiple joint research grants and more than 50 joint publications including in high impact journals such as The Lancet and The Lancet Global Health.According to Altice, \u201cThis training programme will create a new generation of implementation science researchers and practitioners in Malaysia to more adequately scale-up prevention and treatment services in a setting where HIV-related mortality and new HIV infections continue to increase.\u201d \u00a0MIST will train 4 current UM faculty members in implementation science along with 10 doctoral students in public health over the next five years to create the local expertise to address HIV prevention and treatment.MIST will also train 25-30 local public health practitioners during a summer implementation science \u201cboot camp\u201d in Malaysia. This practical training will incorporate implementation science skills embedded within a human rights framework because harsh criminalisation of drugs, sex work and homosexuality have undermined optimal implementation of HIV prevention and treatment services.Adeeba notes that, \u201cThis programme will serve as a model for integrating human rights into real-world implementation for HIV prevention and treatment and hopefully reduce stigma and discrimination toward key populations with or at risk for HIV.\u201d\u201cFurthermore, more the Implementation Science expertise generated from this programme will ultimately be applicable across all diseases,\u201d she adds.Doctoral training will be provided through a hybrid training model where Malaysian trainees will participate in a combination of distance-based and onsite learning with Yale faculty. While at Yale, they will complete one semester of coursework, attend seminars and receive mentorship with leading implementation science experts. Professor Altice will be joined by many other leading implementation science experts at Yale, including Donna Spiegelman, Luke Davis, Sten Vermund and others.Dr. Vermund, Dean of the School of Public Health, remarks that, \u201cYale is deeply committed to international training, which has been transformative both for the university, but especially for our international partners who become our colleagues.\u201d\u201cUniversiti Malaya has begun developing a programme in implementation science. This programme will establish a solid foundation and transform recognition for this emerging area of research for the university and in the region,\u201d states Deputy Dean for Research, Faculty of Medicine, UM, Professor Dr. Ng Chirk Jenn.The two universities are now finalising the curriculum for the training and beginning to select the faculty and PhD candidates who will start in October. \u00a0Trainees will receive a research grant to use their training to conduct research to complement their training."

    "body": "Universiti Malaya (UM), top university in Malaysia, and Clarivate Plc (NYSE: CCC), a global leader in providing trusted information and insights to accelerate the pace of innovation, today released a joint report entitled \u201cThe influence of strategic programs on Universiti Malaya\u2019s research and innovation footprint\u201d. This report aims to provide insights on UM\u2019s policies and strategies, which contributed significantly to its current research performance and global visibility.The report assesses the impact that UM\u2019s High Impact Research (HIR) program, which was launched in 2010, and related government strategic plans have on driving research excellence and improving UM\u2019s global standings over three periods \u2013 2007 to 2010, 2011 to 2014, and 2015 to 2018.Key findings of the report include:High quality research output fuels research impact and performance. One of the key objectives of UM\u2019s HIR program is to put full focus on increasing the number of papers published in Quartile 11(Q1) quality journals indexed in the Web of Science\u2122. The big increase in output of Q1 journal papers drove UM\u2019s improvements in research impact (measured by the Category Normalized Citation Index (CNCI)2) and performance (% papers in top 1% and top 10% of papers based on citations) during the period of 2011 to 2014.\u201cThe report findings prove the decision to insist on publishing in the Web of Science Quartile 1 journals and none other, though controversial at the time, was the right one. The significant increase in high volume and high-quality research drove the dramatic improvement of UM research impact and performance over a short period of time. I am happy and relieved to be proven right! We urge lessons to be drawn from these findings to inform future research agenda and strategies as these would contribute significantly to developing new national economic model and achieving the coveted developed country status,\u201d said former UM Vice-Chancellor, Tan Sri Dr. Ghauth Jasmon, who initiated the program in 2010.The strategic and strong collaboration aspects of the program are also key in driving economic and societal impact. Examples include: the Malaysian Elders Longitudinal Research (MELoR), a project that spanned across nine faculties and has encouraged issues and needs to be addressed across society. Spin-off companies like BioApps Sdn Bhd and UMCH Technology Sdn Bhd have addressed key societal needs and generated significant revenue streams for the university.The program has continued to shape the ongoing culture of pursuing research excellence among UM faculties long after it concluded. The sustained high volume and high impact research publications after 2015 alludes to this newly formed culture of excellence.\"The HIR program has managed to enhance the research culture in UM and strengthen the pursuit of research excellence through publication of research output in high impact journals. \u00a0Through the HIR program, researchers in UM magnified the scope of their research to be more impactful and expanded their horizon to work with the best researchers globally, doing exciting and impactful research that would benefit Malaysia and beyond\u201d, said Prof. Dr. Noorsaadah Abd. Rahman, UM Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research and Innovation).\u201cWe are pleased to work with Universiti Malaya to help it better measure, target and expand the capability of research and innovation efforts. We will continue to work proactively with the research network in Malaysia and rest of Southeast Asia to drive world-class research and innovation,\u201d said Arvind Pachhapur, Vice President and Head of South & Southeast Asia at Clarivate.Download the full reporthere.1Documents in Q1 \u2013 Q4 journals refers to the number of documents that appear in a journal in a Journal Impact Factor Quartile in a given year.2The Category Normalized Citation Impact (CNCI) of a paper is an unbiased indicator of impact irrespective of age, document type and subject category. The Category Normalized Citation Impact of a document is calculated by dividing the actual count of citing items by the expected citation rate for documents with the same document type, year of publication and subject area."

    "body": "University of Malaya (UM) hosted a three-day Erasmus Active Learning research project meeting starting on 9 January 2019 at UM Chancellery Building. This international project aimed to promote Problem-Based Learning (PBL) approaches in Engineering and Technology Education (ALIEN). Partner universities from various countries including Greece, Portugal, United Kingdom, Estonia, Bulgaria, Pakistan, Vietnam, Cambodia and Nepal are involved in the project. Prior to this, the initial meeting was held in June 2018 hosted by the University of Thessaly in Greece.The second meeting in Malaysia was welcomed by Prof. Dr. Kamila Ghazali, UM Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic and International). Prof. Kamila highlighted the position of UM being at the forefront in supporting active learning through enhanced infrastructure known as the \u2018CUBE\u2019 in UM. UM, although known for being the leading university in research, puts equal emphasis on high quality teaching and learning activities. This is in line with the Malaysian government\u2019s aspiration for continually improving the quality of its higher education system where active learning is highly emphasised for the students\u2019 holistic development. Accommodating the transformation brought by the fourth Industrial Revolution, the practice of active learning in UM has been highly supported by appropriate learning spaces. The learning spaces project in UM had started with the experimental Collaborative Interactive Learning Room in 2008. The UM Learning Space Policy in 2012 reinforced the \u2018CUBE\u2019 project and saw the renovation of classrooms in several faculties. Since then, UM has upgraded more than 35 existing spaces into CUBES throughout the campus.\u201cThe CUBE offers conducive, fun and technology assisted learning environment, which is timely for millennials who are currently studying at our university\u201d she added.The era of the traditional classroom setting has passed and it is time to move forward in preparing our students for an exciting career ahead of them. According to Prof. Carlos Vaz de Carvalho, Head of ALIEN and Dr. Hariklia Tsalapatas, project manager, PBL, which is one of the highest forms of active learning approaches, will be supported through fully developed and operational labs that will be installed at partner sites.\u201cThis PBL methodology will also be supported by a virtual learning environment that will allow a multinational community of researchers, lecturers and practitioners to discuss and share best practices in active learning. Eventually, this project will produce an ALIEN online collaborative platform consisting of PBL games and scenarios in a common storage to be shared and used by others\u201d stated Prof. Carlos.UM is one of the universities in Malaysia as a partner country in the ALIEN project consortium. Prof. Dr. Siti Salwah Salim from the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology (FCSIT), UM leads this project and is currently setting up its Active Learning Lab for teaching Software Engineering courses. \u00a0The aim is to equip software engineers for the workplace to solve future problems. Dr. Raja Jamilah Raja Yusof, also from FCSIT and Dr. Aishah Abu Bakar from the Faculty of Engineering, are the co-principal investigators for this project. Both of them have vast experience in transforming and innovating the PBL practice in their courses.This meeting provides a great opportunity for country members to execute the above aspiration in transforming normal classes into active learning spaces."

    "body": "The international partnership between the University of Malaya (UM) and the University of Wales (UW), now in its fifth year, continues to go from strength to strength. The two national institutions came together in March 2011, with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), initially under a Government initiative to establish a new private international university in Malaysia. The partnership was a natural pairing, not least because the UM Chairman, Tan Sri Dato\u2019 Seri Utama Arshad Ayub, is a UW graduate himself.UM and UW created the International University of Malaya-Wales (IUMW) which, after two-years of the institutions working closely together, opened in 2013 and this year has surpassed 1000 student enrolments. Also, in 2013, UM and UW jointly convened the successful \u2018Conference on International Higher Education\u2019 at IUMW under the auspices of the Association of Commonwealth Universities of which both UM and UW are proud to be members.In December 2015, UM and UW renewed their partnership with the signing of a new MoU by the respective Vice-Chancellors to extend academic engagement more broadly, and to welcome the University of Wales Trinity Saint David (UWTSD) into the partnership as UW\u2019s future merger partner. Since then, high-level discussions have been held between UM and UW to explore developing a doctoral scholarship, a dual PhD programme, student and staff exchange programmes, and collaborative research opportunities.The close relationship between UM and UW continues to deepen. At the UW Graduation Celebration in Cardiff earlier this year, Tan Sri Professor Dr Amin Jalaludin, Vice-Chancellor of UM, received an Honorary Doctor of Science award from UW for his outstanding contributions to his academic field and, more recently, Professor Simon Haslett, Pro Vice-Chancellor at UW, began a two-year Visiting Professorship at UM. Going forward, academic staff and students from UM, UW, UWTSD and IUMW are encouraged to take advantage of the opportunities to engage and benefit from the unique Malaya-Wales International Partnership.By Prof. Simon HaslettPhoto: Signing ceremony in December 2015 (left to right): Professor Hamzah A.

It is expected that both organisations will benefit from the collaboration by gaining access to research opportunities and expertise. The partnership will create a platform from which both organisations can benefit.The MoU was signed by UM\u2019s Associate Vice-Chancellor (Global Engagement), Professor Dr. Yvonne Lim Ai Lian and BPAM\u2019s CEO/Executive Director, En. Meor Amri Meor Ayob. This collaboration covers, among others, joint research projects in Environment, Social & Governance (ESG), Fixed Income and Data Science & Machine Learning, internship placements and training programmes. This partnership between the two organisations will pair BPAM\u2019s experience and expertise in the Malaysian Fixed Income Market with the research know-how of UM.BPAM will be able to leverage research and knowledge exchange to strengthen BPAM's core businesses. In particular, the collaboration will explore opportunities for student internships at BPAM and the appointment of BPAM experts as ELITE Fellows in UM to provide students with industry-relevant knowledge. Engaging BPAM staff for postgraduate studies in UM would further strengthen the relationship between the two organisations as it would enable joint research activities as part of the studies. Similarly, Universiti Malaya will be able to engage in industry-relevant research and knowledge transfer to understand the practical aspects of industrial knowledge application that can be further utilised in teaching and research. Efforts are focused on creating tangible impacts to enhance the competitiveness of both organisations.According to En. Meor Amri Meor Ayob, \u201cThere has never been a better time to have this type of smart partnership between market practitioners and academia. Data sciences have evolved tremendously. The need to make sense of the tremendous amount of data to make quick and informed decision requires a new way of data aggregation and analysis. This partnership was envisaged to quicken the time-to-market of innovative tools to support market practitioners, speed up their decision-making process and explore new ways of looking at risk assessment, benchmarking and investment strategies. Higher education has to become a strategic asset that links industry to strengthen the national economy by enhancing and accelerating technology-transfer initiatives.\u201dQuoting Professor Dr. Yvonne, \u201cFostering collaborative university-industry partnerships has emerged as a critical imperative to sustaining global competition, and innovation and business competitiveness are greatly enhanced through the activities of research universities. To build a knowledge-based economy, we need to drive innovation by strengthening links between higher education, research and business practices.\u201d"

    "body": "Picture this: a vibrant morning on August 16, 2023, at the crack of dawn \u2013 7:45 am, to be precise. Something exciting was about to unfold right in the heart of the Chancellery's foyer. It wasn't your typical early morning scene \u2013 it was a gathering that felt more like a mini-adventure with colleagues. Led by none other than the Vice Chancellor, a dynamic crew of around 50 folks showed up, including the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research & Innovation), some seasoned staff, and the gang from various corners of the Chancellery.The action kicked off with an energetic aerobic session that was the brainchild of the incredibly skilled Ms. Ferlynda Fazleen Jamaluddin, an Academic Development and Enhancement Centre (ADeC) superhero. Tunes pumped, feet shuffled, and laughter echoed through the air as people got moving. It wasn't just about getting fit \u2013 it was about shaking off the cobwebs and having a blast. For those who had been more cozy with their desks lately, the exercise brought a mix of relaxation and relief.As the clock struck 8:15 am, the spotlight shifted to the nearby UM Varsity Lake, where the gang was in for a treat \u2013 kayaking time! Imagine the scene: kayaks in the water, sun glinting off the lake, and faces lit up with excitement. Making it even cooler were three top-notch instructors \u2013 Mr. Lotfi Amir, Mr. Shamsudin, and Mr. Azizir \u2013 from the Sports Services Division. They had the scoop on safety and how to paddle like a pro.Over the next 1.5 hours, it was all about soaking in the view \u2013 the tranquil lake, feathered friends like geese and ducks wading along the banks \u2013 it was like stepping into a nature postcard. Teamwork was the name of the game, especially with tandem kayaks that made folks row in sync and high-five for every paddle conquered together.But hey, let's rewind a bit and dive into why these shindigs matter. Those moments of free-spirited fun do more than just make you sweat and laugh. They're like a secret weapon against the stress monsters lurking around the corner. They connect people, let them swap stories, and build friendships that don\u2019t just stop at the water cooler.And here's the twist: this isn't just about burning calories. It's a bit like a mental power-up. Stepping away from desks and meetings, diving into adventures like kayaking, they reset your brain and give your creativity a nudge. You come back to work feeling sharper and ready to rock.This whole deal wasn't just a one-time spectacle. Nope, it's part of a bigger plan, one that the Vice-Chancellor and the Chancellery crew cooked up to keep the good times rolling. This is just the start; a teaser of the awesomeness they've got in store for more memorable escapades. Because, let's face it, a happy team is a powerhouse team. It\u2019s all about work hard, play hard, and come together for the win.Prepared By: Mahadi Sibon"

Organised by the government of China through the office of the Confucius Institute (Kong Zi Institute) in more than 125 countries worldwide, this annual event begins at the national level, where participants battle among themselves to become the next national champion. He or she will then represent his or her respective country in order to compete at the world level in China.Out of 26 participants from 11 universities in Malaysia, Muhamad Shahmeer bin Mohd Nashrul from Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) won first place and this qualifies him to represent Malaysia in the semifinals and finals in China.Shameer then successfully advanced to the finals on 27 July 2017 as he emerged as the champion for the Asian continent. His success entitles him to compete in the finals with 145 students from around the world. On 12 August 2017, Shahmeer wowed the judges yet again and finished as the runner-up at the finals of the 16th Chinese Bridge Chinese Proficiency Competition for Foreign College Students. He also bagged the \u201cBest Oral Award\u201d, \u201cAsian Champions\u201d, and \u201cConfucius Institute Scholarship\u201d in the finals. This is the best achievement among Malaysian students since they began participating in the Chinese Bridge Competition.Aside from his deep passion and appreciation for Chinese culture, his achievement is nonetheless attributed to the intensive training Shameer received under the supervision of Miss Pan ChunPing, from KZIUM prior to the semifinals and finals. From the training, he has enhanced his proficiency in the Chinese language and the general knowledge of China, the Chinese history as well as Chinese art and culture."

The concerning addition of positive cases among medical staffs may lead to a shortage of healthcare personnel that can work be on duty during the pandemic.One of the main reasons how medical staffs could get infected might be due to the close contact with infected patients while examining and administering breathing support machine to the patients. This close contact risks medical staffs of being infected with the Coronavirus. An increasing number of positive infections among the staffs will eventually lead to the closure of healthcare department and the hospital for sanitization works. Such occurrence would hinder treatment for patients and also increase additional workload to other hospitals to cover for the closure of another hospital.Intubation is a process to secure breathing for patients with severe breathing difficulty. There has been evidence that show that aerosolization can occur during the intubation process. This is concerning as it could be a risk towards medical staffs in getting infected when treating patients.To reduce the infection risk, an innovative protective box named \u2018Aerosol box\u2019 is able to help physicians to perform endotracheal intubations safely on infected patients. This box was created by Lai Hsien-yung, an anesthesiologist with the Mennonite Christian Hospital in Hualien, Taiwan. The \u2018Aerosol box\u2019 acts as a barrier between the doctor and infected patient.The box was designed using a clear acrylic material to ease operation for healthcare personnel when administering the support breathing machine on infected patients. One side of the box has two holes for healthcare personnel to insert and maneuver their hands while examining the patient. On the opposite side from where the holes are located, a plastic sheet is used to cover the area which can accommodate different dimensions of the patient\u2019s body.Responding to the arising needs by medical frontline doctors to overcome this pandemic challenges, the researchers from Centre for Innovation in Medical Engineering (CIME), Department of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Malaya have taken an initiative to fabricate six intubation protective boxes. These boxes were provided urgently to frontline healthcare personnel at University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) upon receiving request for it.These boxes have been delivered to Dr. Khairul Azri at the Emergency Department on 25th March 2020 at 10.30 PM. The initiative work was headed by Prof. Ir. Dr. Fatimah Ibrahim, Ir. Dr. Mas Sahidayana Mokhtar, Prof. Dr. Sajaratulnisah Othman and Prof. Dr. Tan Maw Pin, who are a group of CIME researchers. Additionally, CIME has collaborated with Dr. William Yap from Selayang Hospital and Dr. Izhar Abd Aziz from 3D Gens Sdn. Bhd.CIME has also pledge to deliver these protective boxes to Sungai Buloh, Klang, Shah Alam, Melaka and other hospitals. The top management of Universiti Malaya has supported this project and has given seed funding under the innovate UM fund. This fund accelerates the project in improvising the current intubation protective box to incorporate more safety and ergonomic features.CIME would like to acknowledge to all the contributors from CIME, Universiti Malaya and public who funded the fabrication of the intubation protective box.In response to donations of the Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction RT-PCR COVID-19 test kits from a reputed supplier in Singapore, RT-PCR COVID-19 diagnostic kits for which a total of 250,000 tests are targeted. CIME has assisted in obtaining the Medical Device Authority (MDA) exemption to bring in these tests for non-commercial use. CIME\u2019s assistance in obtaining immediate MDA exemption can aid the country\u2019s fight against this pandemic.The COVID-19 test kits will help ease the burden of laboratories who are regularly running out of reagents to conduct tests. It will also save lab technicians\u2019 time as these kits allow them to do tests without the hassle of replicating new components every time. A grateful thank you to Prof. Ir. Fatimah Ibrahim and Prof. Tan Maw Pin from CIME, UM, Dato\u2019 Prof. Dr. Adeeba Kamarulzaman, Dean, Faculty of Medicine, UM, Encik Ahmad Shariff (CEO of MDA) and Madam Ir. Sasikala Devi Thangavelu (Director for Policy, Code and Standard Division of MDA) for their cooperation and support in obtaining MDA approval within a day.By Prof. Ir.

Posting my story out there, I received multiple messages from people that could relate and have been in similar positions and it is a little relieving to feel that we are not the only ones who feel or go through as such. And if others can make it through, we surely can too.\u201cI started getting involved in leadership roles for the past many years and most recently is women empowerment. I believe everyone has a voice and we should be allowed to use it wisely. Built mostly, we should be given the chance to use it. So, I would highly urge young girls and women out there to take a shot, take a chance at whatever challenges life throws at you. Because chances are you might excel at it and you will never know if you never try.\u201cMost importantly I am happy that I have been given a chance to make it to the top 100 and that I could encourage others out there to challenge themselves regardless of what others say because people will always have something to say anyway. I hope that I can be shortlisted to the top 10,\u201d she said.Annsley also added that, everyone has a story, regardless good or bad, sweet or bitter.\u201cTaking a glimpse through mine, I could label it as a bittersweet good story. You cannot compare your life story with someone else just because it doesn\u2019t go the way you want it to.

    "title": "TASIK VARSITY - THE HEART OF UM",
    "body": "Tasik Varsiti is an urban lake in a park that is smacked right in the middle of the campus and the perfect spot for a short escape into nature. It is a man-made lake that has been around for a very long time, possibly even before the campus in Kuala Lumpur was established. Those who were around in the early days would remember a different look of the lake than what we can see today - the lake was bigger and wider then and almost twice its current size, extending right to the green field in front of the library. During its heyday, the lake was the centre for a plethora of activities - students could be seen cheering for their fellow comrades in the silly, but fun duck-catching competition; freshies would make for the lake during orientation week to train for boat race competitions; a floating boat house would be constructed at the lake during convocation week; \u2018baptism\u2019 ceremonies were held for newly elected committee members; gotong-royong activities to beautify were a constant feature; and it was also the favoured venue for lovers to profess their undying love.However when development in the surrounding areas around the lake began, for many, it sealed the fate of the lake. During the construction of Dewan Tunku Canselor and several residential colleges nearby, the excavation and deposition activities washed a great deal of sediment and rocks into the lake. These activities created a mud pool that eventually resulted in silting up a big part of the lake. Other consequences soon followed - algal blooms, poor drainage which later polluted the water, drying up of the lake during the dry season and the overflow of murky water from the river. Fortunately throughout the years, many actions have been taken to save the lake. For example, the former Vice Chancellor, Royal Professor Ungku Abdul Aziz Ungku Abdul Hamid initiated a limnology research at the lake, while the late Tan Sri Dr. Abdullah Sanusi Ahmad contributed in beautifying the surrounding landscape by planting a large number of trees.20\u00a0November\u00a02014 was a memorable day in the history of the lake as the community participated in a swimming competition at the lake \u2013 a testimony that good water quality at the lake has finally returned.Currently efforts from the Water Warriors project have identified more than 40 species of plants, 20 types of birds and 26 varieties of fish that call the lake home. Not forgetting too, the many other kinds of insects, rodents, reptiles and amphibians that complete and balance the ecosystem of the lake. The lake has lived up to its image as the focal point for the campus community - the scenery sets the perfect setting to hold gatherings, kayaking on the lake is perfect for those who like to be on the water, joggers can enjoy the scenery around the lake as they take to the jogging path , and as for researchers and nature enthusiasts, the lake never fails to surprise as its hidden gems continue to be uncovered.Water Warriors is a living lab project. We dream of turning Tasik Varsiti into a sustainable lake with an open classroom concept where the community can participate in citizen science and environmental education.By Siti Norasiah Abd Kadir"

River preservation is the responsibility of all parties, not a responsibility limited or specific to an agency or a non-governmental organisation.\u201cThe responsibility of preserving the river needs to be highlighted in the form of environmentally-friendly living practices and a proactive attitude to contribute or be willing to pay the necessary costs,\u201d said His Royal Highness Sultan Nazrin.According to Dato\u2019 Professor Dr. Zulkifli Mohd Yusoff, the motivation behind creating this book stemmed from our recognition of the abundant references to water sources, particularly rivers, in the verses of the Qur'an and the hadiths of the Prophet Muhammad SAW.\u201cDespite this rich content, there has been a notable absence of discussions regarding rivers in the context of community development, environmental activism, or the formation of knowledge councils worldwide as outlined in the Qur'an and hadiths,\u201d he added.Based on the Environmental Quality Report 2021 of 670 rivers monitored in Malaysia, 489 of the rivers or 73% showed a clean water quality index, 24% (158 rivers) were moderately polluted and 3% (23 rivers) were polluted."

This campaign will be a recurring event that takes place yearly in November from 2020 till 2024.According to the Malaysian National Cancer Registry, more than 60% of prostate cancer cases are diagnosed at the advanced stage (Stages 3 and 4) whilst the comparable statistics are much lower in Singapore (25-30%) and US (less than 20%). The campaign aims to lower the number of newly-diagnosed advanced prostate cancer from over 60% to 30% by 2025.To achieve the target, the campaign adopts a multi-prong approach. In 2020, the campaign will initiate:A month-long #onlymencan campaign to create public awareness on prostate cancer. Key messages of the campaign will\u00a0 be disseminated via advertisements, interviews and key opinion leaders.Knowledge enhancement programmes on prostate cancer for medical practitioners. Primary care doctors in both public and private sectors will attend online training courses to learn the latest updates on prostate cancer screening, diagnosis and treatment in order to provide the best possible care for patients.A dedicated #onlymencan website that contains health education resources for public, patients and healthcare professionals will be built as a one-stop virtual resource centre for prostate cancer in Malaysia.In the US where testing is more widespread, 1 in 9 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime. Fortunately, it is also one of the most treatable forms of cancer: if detected early with a survival rate of more than 90% for at least 10 years.Dato\u2019 Sri Nazir, a prostate cancer survivor said \u201cSo many more men die or suffer terribly because they fail to detect prostate cancer early enough.

    "body": "The gig economy is an inevitable development, and although it represents opportunity for both employer and employee, it might just be a symptom of a larger, looming problem. \u201cThe Gig Economy - Disruptive Innovation or Opportunity for Exploitation\u201d forum on 19 February 2019 was curated by the office of Industry and Community Engagements, University of Malaya (UM) at UM under the auspices of the Committee of Deputy Vice Chancellors (Industry and Community Networks) of public universities and Department of Higher Education Malaysia.Freelancing and participation in gig economy is getting more popular, especially among millennials who prefer flexible working conditions and job-hopping. Unlike full-time workers who focus on a lifetime career, freelancers or gig workers thrive in pursuing temporary and flexible jobs offered by clients, normally with very specific scope and instructions.\"The trend is moving towards (the gig economy) simply because we have more tools and more access,\" said Shareen Shariza Abdul Ghani, one of the forum\u2019s panelists. She referred to changes in three things: how people work, and the tools used; improvements in workforce policies; and changes in the workplace itself. \"It is real, it is here,\" she concluded.The Forum was moderated by Professor Dr. Evelyn Devadason from UM and the panelist include Mr. Robert Benetello (CEO of EUMCCI), Mr. Sam Shafie (CEO of PitchIN Equity Crowdfunding, Watch Tower & Friends), Mr Darzy Norhalim (Director of the Sharing Economy Ecosystem Division, Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC), Ms. Shareem Shariza Dato Abdul Ghani (Co-founder and Director of Sourga Ventures S/B as well as former CEO of Talent Corporation and Ms. Pathma Subramaniam (senior writer for Enterprise and Personal Wealth, The Edge Malaysia). This forum attempted to assess the various impacts of participation in gig economy especially from the higher education viewpoint and what can be done to ensure sufficient preparation and adaptation are made by both academia and industry in addressing this new working phenomenon.Gig economy has grown by 31% in 2017, a growth figure that surpassed the conventional workforce according to EPF Malaysia. \"In the next five years, 40% (of a company's workforce) will be coming from contingent workers,\" elaborated Shareen, while pointing out that it's not a phenomenon that only affects the young.Although the gig economy has increased the work efficiency and reduce the cost of doing business, it is also raising concerns on social safety nets, financial security, retirement plans, health and wellbeing. Life can be stressful and challenging without savings for the future. In addition, the ability to work may be reduced due to sickness, aging, reduction of competitive edge and other factors.A recently published study by Oxford University highlighted that the working autonomy and flexibility associated with the digital gig economy often lead to long, irregular and anti-social working hours which can contribute to sleep deprivation and exhaustion. \"The legal framework in terms of social security, insurance, contracts and all that is really important,\" said Robert Benetello, \"I think it's something that needs to be developed in Malaysia.\u201dThere have been several discourses on the benefits, impact and challenges of gig economy on Malaysians. Unlike in traditional education system, the requirement for survival in the gig economy emphasises competency in specific skill sets rather than general education requirements.Written by: Dr. Bong Yii Bonn"

Kita buat kerja halal; bukannya mencuri,\u201d kata Akhbar Rahman, Pemandu Kenderaan H11 di Jabatan Pembangunan dan Pengurusan Harta Benda (JPPHB) Universiti Malaya ketika kami temui baru-baru ini.Akhbar merupakan salah seorang daripada tiga orang pemandu JPPHB yang ditugaskan untuk memandu lori pembersihan ke seluruh kawasan kampus bagi mengutip sampah sarap yang terkumpul di semua lokasi rumah sampah. \u201cSetiap hari, sekurang-kurangnya saya akan memandu sejauh 50 kilometer bagi mengutip sampah. Dua kali trip waktu pagi, dan sekali lagi di waktu petang,\u201d terangnya mengenai tugas penting yang diamanahkan kepadanya.Ayah kepada seorang anak ini memaklumkan yang dirinya bukan hanya mampu memandu kereta dan lori, malah kesemua kenderaan yang dimiliki universiti, termasuklah traktor, bas persiaran dan kren pengangkat (\u2018skylift\u2019). \u201cTapi saya tetap paling bangga dengan tugas utama saya ini, iaitu memandu lori sampah. Kalau kami tak bergerak, habis kotor kampus kita!\u201d katanya, sambil tersenyum.Anak jati Melaka yang telah bertugas di UM sejak tahun 2001 ini tertawa bila kami inginkan kepastian sama ada antara kriteria menjadi pemandu lori perlulah mempunyai saiz fizikal yang besar. \u201cSalah tu. Jawapannya tidak sama sekali. Kebetulan sahaja saya memang berbadan besar dan bertugas sebagai pemandu. Yang paling penting ialah ilmu, daya fokus yang tinggi ketika memandu, dan kemahuan untuk memajukan diri dalam kerjaya.Dan bercakap mengenai kerjaya, suka saya berkongsi pesanan arwah ibu saya semasa mula-mula bekerja dengan UM dahulu: jangan tinggal solat, jangan ambil hak orang, dan sentiasa berlapang dada dengan rezeki yang Tuhan aturkan. Kita kena sentiasa jujur dan bertanggungjawab dengan amanah yang diberi,\u201d kongsinya.Ditanya mengenai perancangan menjelang tarikh persaraannya yang bakal tiba tidak lama lagi, penggemar asam pedas ikan pari ini pantas menjawab: \u201cSaya sebenarnya ada impian nak dapatkan satu lagi lesen memandu. Kenderaan yang sangat istimewa, dan hanya lesen membawa kenderaan itu saja yang saya belum ada.\u201d\u201cLesen apa tu bang?\u201d tanya jurufoto kami.\u201cSaya nak ada lesen kapal terbang!\u201d selorohnya, sambil memulakan enjin lorinya bagi memulakan perjalanan syif petang mengelilingi kampus.\u2026\u2026\ud83d\udcf8Photos by Mohd.

    "body": "The Asia-Europe Institute (AEI) of Universiti Malaya (UM) and Huawei Technologies (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd (Huawei) have teamed up for the purpose of accelerating Malaysia\u2019s transformation into an advanced digital economy by 2030. The collaboration comes in line with the Malaysia Digital Economy Blueprint, or MyDIGITAL, which was launched by Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin on February 19 this year. MyDIGITAL maps out the many aspects of the digital economy as it looks to ensuring that the public, as well as the business and government sectors, are digitally enabled and integrated.The collaboration, which aims to foster closer cooperation between the industry and academia, was sealed today through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) which will first see a jointly hosted Digital Economy Summit in September 2021, which will include the participation of universities, think tanks and industry associations.Mr Michael Yuan, CEO of Huawei Malaysia signed the MoU on behalf of Huawei with Ms Rita Irina Abd Wahab, Huawei Malaysia\u2019s Vice President of Public Affairs and Communications, as the witness. Professor Dato\u2019 Ir. Dr. Mohd Hamdi Abd Shukor, Vice-Chancellor of Universiti Malaya, signed the MoU while Associate Professor Dr. Jatswan Singh, the Executive Director of the Asia-Europe Institute (AEI), acted as witness.It is also worth noting that both parties will be releasing a collection of academic papers focusing on the digital economy, to be published by the Oxford University Press, which will then be a source of reference for global technology leaders.Speaking on behalf of Professor Dato\u2019 Ir. Dr Mohd Hamdi Abd Shukor, Professor Dr. Noorsaadah Abd. Rahman, Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research & Innovation) said that the exchanging of this MOU today builds and further strengthens the collaboration between Universiti Malaya and the private sector on common areas of interests between both parties.\"This is a joint public-academia and industry initiative to introduce and nurture digital competencies, creativity and innovation among students and also to help accelerate the nation\u2019s digital economy vision for the country,\" she said.She also noted that in this era of Industrial Revolution 4.0 (IR4) and as the nation progresses towards Malaysia 5.0, it is important to recognise the value of digital technology and telecommunications.\u201cBy harnessing the power of the latest advancements offered by AI (Artificial Intelligence), Cloud Computing, Internet of Things (IoT), automation, augmented reality and Big Data Analytics (BDA), UM is looking to expand its reach and value by partnering with industry players like Huawei and other organisations to strengthen digital creativity and innovation amongst students.\u201cWith this smart partnership between UM and Huawei, we hope to create a future-ready workforce, by empowering students and the younger generation with critical and digital skills required to meet the demands of digital jobs. This joint venture will see the creation of possibilities and opportunities with limitless boundaries through technology, eventually bridging the digital divide in the country. This partnership marks an important milestone in UM\u2019s continuous efforts to digitally empower our students, academics and researchers in building a vibrant digital ecosystem and further accelerate the Malaysian digital economy,\u201d Professor Dr. Noorsaadah said.In his speech at the MoU exchange ceremony, Mr Choh Yau Meng, Huawei Malaysia Vice President of Human Resources, said that in light of the accelerated need for digitalisation across all sectors of the economy, which has been catalysed by the COVID-19 pandemic, it was crucial for businesses, organisations and individuals alike to pivot towards a more digital economy.\u201cThe convergence of new technologies will pave the way for new and modern business models, innovation and a wide pool of opportunities for advancement of industries, which in turn will accelerate the growth of Malaysia\u2019s digital economy,\u201d he said.\u201cA more advanced digital economy will open up many more job opportunities, which will then widen the nation\u2019s capacity for a larger talent pool of tech experts which are already highly sought-after skillsets, as the world moves rapidly further into the digital era,\u201d Mr. Choh commented, adding that this will also firmly place Malaysia at the forefront among its neighbours, as a regional digital hub.\u201cAs a global technology leader, Huawei is always ready to lend our knowledge and resources towards helping the country achieve its digital transformation goals. Hence, collaborations such as our latest initiative with Universiti Malaya\u2019s Asia-Europe Institute are crucial to encourage knowledge sharing as well as to establish best practices for driving change,\u201d Mr. Choh said.Huawei and Universiti Malaya have enjoyed a good working relationship since 2018, when the Huawei ICT Academy programme with the university was rolled out. To date, 120 UM students have benefitted from the Huawei ICT Academy. More than 180 UM graduates are also currently employees of Huawei Malaysia. As part of its commitment to nurture the next generation of digital talents, Huawei Malaysia has taken in 18 UM graduates as interns since 2018 and offered scholarships to six of its students.The Huawei ICT Academy is now part of the Huawei ASEAN Academy, which was established in May 2020. As of March 2021, the Huawei ASEAN Academy has trained more than 8,800 Malaysians and intends to train 50,000 ICT talents over the next five years. Huawei Malaysia plans to continue providing talent training services for Malaysia's digital economy through Huawei's online and offline platforms.Also present at the event today were Professor Dr. Rofina Yasmin Othman, Associate Vice-Chancellor (Industry & Community Networks), Universiti Malaya; Associate Prof. Dr. Jatswan Singh, Executive Director of the AEI, Universiti Malaya; Oliver Liu, Vice-Chancellor, Huawei ASEAN Academy; and Dikhwan Hady Darnalis, Director, Public Affairs and Communications, Huawei Malaysia.#UMisOne#ServingTheNation#ImpactingTheWorld"

    "body": "Inspired by Professor Khairuddin Yusof - a Universiti Malaya\u2019s Emeritus Professor who attempted to climb Aconcagua about 25 years ago, Professor Dr. Ghazali Musa, from the Faculty of Business and\u00a0Accountancy went to Argentina at end of January 2019 to climb the same mountain. On 15 February 2019, after 15 days climbing, he summited Mt. Aconcagua (6962m), the tallest mountain in the continents of America along with his Polish and Russian friends with neither the services of porters nor mountain guides.\u201cWe wanted to be self-sufficient and do everything ourselves,\u201d said Ghazali. He added that Aconcagua is a hard mountain to climb, for its high altitude and unstable weather condition.\u201cIt\u2019s more of my mental strength which dragged me up to the summit, rather than my physical strength,\u201d he confessed.Ghazali, 52, is no stranger to Universiti Malaya (UM). He spent almost three decades in the University, studying pre-university foundation and medical degree and later working as a medical officer for five years. He left medical profession to pursue his tourism study in New Zealand from 1998 to 2002. In 2004, he returned to UM, and this time at the Faculty of Business and Accountancy. Professor Ghazali is a prolific researcher, promoted quickly to a full professor in 2012. He currently is the most cited tourism professor in the country. In 2017, he received the award of distinguished researcher for social science in UM.Born in Marang (Terengganu), Professor Ghazali has always been an adventurous person. He has travelled to over 100 countries and took part in many adventurous activities, of which two that he is most passionate about are mountaineering and open water swimming. Climbing Aconcagua is a part of his training plan to climb Mount Everest in 2022. Last year, Professor Ghazali attempted to swim across the 38km Melaka Straits from Rupat Island (Indonesia) to Port Dickson Malaysia. After 13 hours swimming, covering the distance of 31km, he was forced to quit due to heavy storm, 8km before reaching Port Dickson.\u201cIt was an unfinished business and an unfulfilled dream,\u201d uttered Ghazali. His aim is not only to break the Guinness World Record as the oldest swimmer to swim across the straits but also to hold the fastest unofficial current record of 22 hours.It is Professor Ghazali\u2019s hope to have support the Ministry of Youth and Sports to swim the straits again either this year or next year. The University congratulates Professor Ghazali for his success in summiting Aconcagua recently, and wishes the best for his second attempt to swim across Melaka Straits."

In\u00a0ranking\u00a065th, it achieves its second-best performance in the history of the\u00a0rankings. There are more than 25,000 institutions of higher learning worldwide.Universiti Malaya\u2019s top-100 status is based on outstanding recognition amongst academics and employers. Its scores for\u00a0QS\u2019s reputational indicators \u2013 Academic Reputation (72nd, 76.9 percent) and Employer Reputation - have trended upwards over the last year, and it has now achieved one of the world\u2019s top 50 Employer Reputation scores (46th, 91.7 percent) for the first time.According to\u00a0QS\u00a0Quacquarelli Symonds, global higher education analysts, the Academic Reputation Index is the centrepiece of the\u00a0QS\u00a0World University\u00a0Rankings\u00ae, carrying a weighting of 40 percent. It is an approach to international university evaluation that\u00a0QS\u00a0pioneered in 2004 and based on survey responses from over 130,000 academics, is the component that attracts the greatest interest and scrutiny.The Employer Reputation metric is based on\u00a0almost 75,000 responses to the\u00a0QS\u00a0Employer Survey, and asks employers to identify institutions from which they source the most competent, innovative and effective graduates. The\u00a0QS\u00a0Employer Survey is also the world\u2019s largest of its kind.According to Universiti Malaya\u2019s Vice-Chancellor, Professor Dato\u2019 Ir. Dr. Mohd Hamdi Abd Shukor, this year\u2019s achievement of breaking through the world\u2019s top 50 in Employer Reputation is a testament to Universiti Malaya\u2019s success in providing education as a means by which students can receive valuable preparation for the employment market.\u201cWe are currently implementing a more robust teaching and learning component through precision intervention, where we identify students\u2019 inclination, character, personality, and mental strength through psychometric tests in order to adapt a more precise approach in teaching and learning to cultivate their potential to the highest extent.\u201cIn addition, we have introduced the ELITE@UM (Experiential Learning with Industries and Technocrats) programme, where students will learn directly from industry leaders. Currently, we have appointed distinguished leaders such as Tan Sri Syed Hamid Albar, Former Minister of Foreign Affairs; Tan Sri Chan Kong Choy, Former Minister of Transport; Dato\u2019 Kamaruzzaman Abu Kassim, Former CEO of Johor Corporation (JCorp), Mohd Muazzam Mohamed, CEO of Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd (BIMB) and many others as adjunct professors, where they will present lectures to our students. The desired outcome for this initiative is to create more future leaders in every field that our graduates venture into\u201d.In other areas, Universiti Malaya is\u00a0ranked\u00a0at 285 (Citations per Faculty), 155 (Faculty/Student ratio), 312 (International Faculty) and 333 (International Students), contributing to an overall score of 69.8 percent, slipping by a slim margin of 0.43 percent from last year.\u201cWe had predicted the slip as our growth slowed down especially in terms of publications. We are focusing on ways to mitigate further decline and have identified factors that need immediate attention.\u201cFirst and foremost, our research productivity needs to be doubled, which means that we need more research grants as they contribute to research work, equipment maintenance, as well as employment of good postdoctoral fellows and researchers, which in turn contributes to high-impact research.\u201cFaculty to student ratio also needs to be managed appropriately, where we need to realign our number of full-time staff in addition to attracting, recruiting and retaining international staff at all levels.\u201dDato\u2019 Hamdi reassures that actions are underway to enable Universiti Malaya to maintain its quality and reputation through the recently-announced Universiti Malaya Strategic Plan (2021-2025).He also welcomed the brighter news that in total,\u00a0QS\u00a0has\u00a0ranked\u00a022 Malaysian institutions in this year\u2019s\u00a0rankings\u00a0\u2013 a record high number.\u201cI wish to congratulate all the institutions listed and especially the Ministry of Higher Education for the support and leadership that has enabled Malaysia to garner increasing recognition on the global stage.\u201cIn our bid to serve the nation and impact the world, Universiti Malaya is also thankful to many who have been with us through our ups and downs.\u201cI would like to thank the University community - staff and students, as well as our partners and collaborators for their commitment and contribution. My sincerest gratitude goes to the Chancellor, Pro-Chancellors and Board of Directors of Universiti Malaya for their strong support.\u201cI am pleased that Universiti Malaya continues to place Malaysia on the global stage through our dedication, commitment, and hard work towards serving the nation and impacting the world.

    "body": "Now everyone can build a house! The tagline aptly describes the research efforts of the Faculty of Engineering in constructing the first Model Low Cost House (MLCH) incorporating green technology as part of the Vice-Chancellor\u2019s vision in promoting community engagement projects.In the MLCH project, research outputs from the Centre for Innovative Construction Technology (CICT) were implemented to help address issues related to sustainability and reduction in the cost of construction.Launched by the Minister of Education, Dato\u2019 Seri Idris Jusoh recently, the construction of the Green Low Cost House was successfully completed in 3 months at the Faculty of Engineering.The success can be attributed to the successful Institute-Industry collaboration between UM and VINCI Construction Grands Projects Sdn. Bhd. The design and construction of the Green Low Cost House was also assisted by CKYIBS (M) Sdn. Bhd. and the Faculty of Built Environment.The Green Low Cost House design was based on masonry structure system, focusing on the application of load-bearing interlocking brick system. Waste materials such as POC, slag, POC ash and quarry wastes were introduced in the brick system as well as the foundation of the Green Low Cost House. The single-storey Green Low Cost House has a built-up area of 808 square feet, consisting of 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a combined living room/kitchen area with targeted total construction material cost below RM 20,000.The CICT has been researching on the use of local waste materials for partial and full cement replacements for more than 10 years. For partial cement replacement, materials like palm oil fuel ash (POFA), palm oil clinker (POC) ash, rice husk ash (RHA) and coal bottom ash (CBA) have shown great potential.In the case of full cement replacement, such materials need to be combined with activators to give binding properties to the concrete. This type of cement-free concrete is commonly termed as \u2018geopolymer concrete\u2019. In addition, local waste materials such as POC, oil palm shell (OPS) and slag were found to be good alternatives as coarse and fine aggregates in concrete.Considering most of these materials are consistently available, utilization of these materials promotes recycling of wastes. As some of these wastes are considered a nuisance to the industry, encouraging the usage of these wastes and also helps in the problems of disposal. Furthermore, Malaysia\u2019s natural aggregates and sand are rapidly depleting and such initiatives can help in mitigating the problem. Finally, high level carbon dioxide emission and consumption of huge amount of energy are prevalent in cement-manufacturing industry so by reducing or eliminating the usage of cement, these problems can be moderated.The launch of the MLCH project thus holds exciting potential for the housing industry as well as turning the dream of owning a house for those in the low income group a reality.By Harris Rajahdin"

    "body": "The newly releasedQuacquarelli Symonds (QS) World University Rankings 2019reported a Malaysian university being positioned among the world top 100 universities for the first time. University of Malaya (UM), ranked 87, made this landmark achievement in the history of higher education of Malaysia by moving up 27 places from last year. The rapid rise in its ranking by 80 places since 2014 placed UM within the top 9% of 1,011 institutions ranked by QS in its latest release. Globally, UM is within the top 1% of approximately 26,000 universities.Earlier, at the beginning of the year, UM emerged top in Malaysia in the QS World University Rankings by Subject 2018 for all the five faculty areas the rankings covered. These are Arts & Humanities, Engineering & Technology, Life Science & Medicine, Natural Sciences, and Social Science & Management. The university also broke its own record by making it to the top 50 in the world in seven subjects: Library & Information Management (24), Development Studies (30), Electrical & Electronics Engineering (30), Mineral & Mining (47), Mechanical, Aeronautical & Manufacturing (41), Chemical Engineering (42) and Civil & Structure Engineering (46).Caught by surprise, the UM community is delighted with this achievement that did them proud. While he remained humble, Datuk Ir. (Dr.) Abdul Rahim Hj. Hashim, the Vice-Chancellor added that this is also pride of the nation. Datuk Ir. (Dr.) Abdul Rahim Hj. Hashim attributed this success to the commitment of all UM staff and their dedication towards achieving the goals set in the University\u2019s strategic plan to strengthen its fundamentals particularly in teaching, research and international collaboration. He emphasized that the work done by his predecessors and the university for the past years has laid a strong foundation that paved the way to the top 100.Further analysis into the ranking results showed that the gains through three indicators, namely academic reputation, employer reputation, and citations per faculty leapfrogged the university into the top 100. The first two are indicators of the university\u2019s reputation among the academic community and employers respectively, and the third measures the impact of its publications. These, according to the Vice-Chancellor, represent global acknowledgement and recognition of UM\u2019s quality in teaching and research. He highlighted that UM\u2019s assiduous efforts in strengthening research, internationalisation as well as industry engagement over the past few years are now yielding positive results.The emphasis for the university next is the way to move forward. It will continue its primary focus on establishing stronger academic fundamentals. Only through such efforts, the university can maintain or better its ranking in the coming years. Intensification of international collaborations and enhancing research and industry partnerships are among its top priority. Its position in the top 100 augurs well for UM to attract internationally renowned institutions and industry partners to work with UM, as well as to attract out-standing students from around the world to enroll in its programmes.The university is fully aware of the challenges ahead for realization of its full potential. The results this year that saw a continuous drop in the ranking of the international staff indicator further deepened the university\u2019s concern of its plan to expand its talent pool. The cut in the government\u2019s allocation to the university had adverse implications on its international staff intake and ability to retain productive retired academics on contract. The university\u2019s efforts towards financial sustainability will not yield immediate results to bridge the shortfall due to the drop in government funding.Datuk Ir. (Dr.) Abdul Rahim Hj. Hashim would like to thank the Chancellor of UM, Pro-Chancellors and Board of Directors for their unwavering support. He also acknowledged the support of the Ministry of Education Malaysia that made it possible for UM\u2019s achievement. He reiterated that the Ministry\u2019s assistance is imperative to further develop the country\u2019s premier university to bring it to new heights."

    "body": "Amidst the swing of birdies, eagles and albatross, all ties were renewed and new friendships forged when the University of Malaya hosted the UM-National University of Singapore (UM-NUS) golf tournament at the Kota Permai Golf & Country Club, Kota Kemuning and Palm Garden Golf Club, Putrajaya.Hosted by UM after a hiatus in 2014 due to the unfortunate demise of the late Chancellor, Almarhum Sultan Azlan Shah, the golfers enjoyed a wonderful time during the three-day event, pitting their skills against one another at the Kota Permai Golf & Country Club, Kota Kemuning and Palm Garden Golf Club, Putrajaya.Led by His Royal Highness, Sultan Nazrin Muizzuddin Shah, Sultan of Perak and the current Chancellor of UM and His Excellency, Dr. Tony Tan Keng Yam, President of Singapore, the contingent of UM comprised of 63 members from the management, academic community and staff while NUS brought a strong contingent of 62 to do battle on the green in Malaysia.At the official dinner held at the Ballroom, Putrajaya Marriot Hotel, cultural performances filled the air alongside a delicious feast fit for a king and a queen. There were exchange of gifts between the team captains, the Vice Chancellors and finally between the Chancellors of the two universities.UM Vice-Chancellor Tan Sri Professor Dr. Mohd Amin Jalaludin, in his message expressed his delight at the organization of the UM-NUS golf tournament in Malaysia after a hiatus of two years.\u201cThe Tunku Chancellor Golf Tournament is always a special event for the two universities. It is the only event in the calendar where His Excellency, Dr. Tony Tan, President of the Republic of Singapore and the Chancellor of NUS and His Royal Highness Sultan Nazrin Muizzuddin Shah, Sultan of Perak and Chancellor of the University of Malaya, grace an occasion together.\u201cThe presence of both Chancellors symbolizes the importance that both institutions place on our relationship and also celebrates the close bond and friendship between our institutions,\u201d he said.The idea of hosting inter-varsity games for staff members of the two institutions originated from students who had already been interacting for many years in the Inter-University and Inter-Hall tournaments. In 1962, UM had already moved to the campus in Kuala Lumpur but friendship with NUS continued to flourish through these inter-varsity games. Thus, it was on the greens of the Royal Selangor Golf Club in 1967 that the idea of an annual golf tournament germinated and the University Staff Golf Club of the University of Malaya was subsequently established on 30 August 1968.UM was blessed that the Chancellor, Tunku Abdul Rahman was himself a keen golfer and so was Professor Yeoh Ghim Seng, Chairman of the University Council in NUS. Thus, the proposal for hosting an annual golf tournament for staff to foster goodwill was received with much enthusiasm and given full support by both institutions.The annual tournament has continued since 1968 when the first historic match\u00a0 was played on the greens of the Subang Golf Club. From then on, both institutions have been\u00a0 taking turns to host the tournament. While both teams put their best swing forward every year, winning the Tunku Chancellor Challenge Trophy is regarded a bonus, not the main objective of the tournament. Ultimately, the prize that everyone takes home is the laughter, the camaraderie and the friendships which are embellished not on sliver but in the memories of all who participated.By Harris Rajahdin"

Peralatan pembelajaran di dalam makmal, kerusi serta meja hampir kesemuanya diliputi lumpur kering dan menunggu tenaga dan masa untuk dibersihkan.Sukarelawan UM adalah bukan kumpulan pertama yang datang ke sekolah ini, namun disebabkan kesan kerosakan yang agak teruk, kerja-kerja pembersihan tidak boleh dihabiskan dalam masa satu hari sahaja.Itulah gambaran keadaan sekolah yang perlu dibersihkan oleh 80 pelajar dan staf UM yang menyertai Misi Bantuan Banjir UM Fasa II di Kelantan pada 9 \u2013 13 Januari lepas.Kumpulan sukarelawan ini berkampung selama 2 hari di Kolej Vokasional Tanah Merah dan sehari di SK Tanah Merah 2 bagi membantu kerja-kerja pembersihan kedua-dua sekolah ini.Walaupun kehadiran kumpulan sukarelawan UM lengkap dengan peralatan pembersihan seperti water jet dan tangki air, namun kekurangan bekalan air menjejaskan kerja pembersihan yang telah dirancang.Ternyata kerja-kerja pembersihan bukan satu tugas yang mudah sehinggakan pada satu peringkat sukarelawan UM mengambil inisiatif mengangkut air menggunakan baldi dari sumber air yang berdekatan sementara menantikan wakil dari Jabatan Pembangunan & Penyelengaraan Harta Benda (JPPHB), UM menyiapkan penyambungan paip getah dari sumber air seperti pili bomba atau tasik.Setiap sudut bilik darjah dan makmal yang perlu dibersihkan akan ada sukarelawan yang bersedia dengan penyapu, kain, baldi dan pelbagai peralatan lain untuk membersihkannya. Sukarelawan terbabit tanpa perlu disuruh akan tahu apa yang perlu mereka lakukan setelah melihat sendiri keadaan bilik darjah/makmal.Kumpulan sukarelawan UM ternyata tidak mengenal erti penat atau lelah demi memastikan misi yang disertai mereka berjaya dilaksanakan. Seawal jam 8.00 pagi, kumpulan ini yang ditempatkan di kampus UM Nilam Puri, Kelantan bertolak ke sekolah yang telah dikenalpasti dan pulang menjelang petang setelah bertungkus-lumus melakukan kerja-kerja pembersihan.Setelah tiga hari mengerah tenaga dan keringat serta diuji dengan pelbagai halangan, bilik-bilik darjah dan makmal di sekolah-sekolah yang di bawah tanggungjawab sukarelawan UM berjaya dibersihkan.Terlebih dahulu, Misi Bantuan Banjir UM Fasa I yang berada di Kelantan pada 5 \u2013 9 Januari berjaya membersihkan 7 buah sekolah di Pasir Mas, Kelantan.Walaupun tidak mungkin mampu merasai derita yang dialami oleh mangsa-mangsa banjir di Kelantan, namun sumbangan kecil daripada warga UM ini diharap mampu memberi semangat kepada mereka terlibat untuk bangkit meneruskan kehidupan seperti biasa."

    "title": "SYNCED WITH 12TH MALAYSIA PLAN, ILO-UK-UM PARTNERSHIP TO BOOST MALAYSIA'S TVET WITH STEM.",
    "body": "The International Labour Organization (ILO), the Universiti Malaya (UM) and the United Kingdom government launched a partnership to boost and promote the future readiness of Malaysia\u2019s technical and vocational education and training (TVET) and skills development systems with the integration of generic skills related to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).The partnership is synchronised with the 12th Malaysia Plan, the country\u2019s biggest five-year development plan unveiled yesterday by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob. Strengthening STEM and TVET to transform talents for the future of work is among the Plan\u2019s priorities.The ILO-UK-UM initiative will build stakeholders\u2019 understanding of how STEM skills can be integrated into TVET and skills systems to support national aspirations to increase STEM adoption in the country. The initiative will support this by developing a model for integrating STEM elements into the TVET and skills training curriculum, and then share results of the pilot with key TVET and skills actors to implement a wider adoption of the model.The primary focus is on STEM skills related to the construction sector and food processing in the manufacturing sector. The partnership aims to increase employment and career progression opportunities for students and trainees, especially women, youth and other vulnerable groups such as members of the bottom 40% (B40).With technical support from the Skills for Prosperity Programme in Malaysia (SfP-Malaysia), which is led by the ILO and funded by the UK, UM \u2013 Malaysia\u2019s oldest university \u2013 will conduct a situational and needs analysis of STEM competencies in skills training and TVET programmes in Malaysia.Following that, UM will enhance TVET and skills programmes by integrating STEM-related generic skills, such as advanced problem-solving skills. \u00a0These skills are particularly relevant to the industry, referring to international initiatives, such as the ILO\u2019s global framework on core skills for life and work in the 21st century and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) J-WEL\u2019s Human Skills Matrix. UM will then run pilot training for students and trainees to test the practicality of this approach.The model, the knowledge gained and the pilot results can provide a solid foundation for replicability and wider adoption by other institutions and industrial sectors, paving the way for greater integration of STEM-related skills into TVET and skills systems.The arrival of this initiative is timely as Malaysia\u2019s educational and training institutions strive to equip graduates with skills and knowledge that meet the demands of smart industry and manufacturing goals leading towards the Industrial Revolution 4.0 (IR 4.0). Integrating STEM into TVET has also become a policy focus of the Malaysian government as it builds a more skilled technical workforce that can adapt to the changing technological landscape.By the end of this year, UM will share the situational and needs analysis report with curriculum drafters such as the Ministry of Human Resources (MOHR), Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE), polytechnics, community colleges and skills training institutes to promote further inclusion of STEM in TVET and skills training. At the same time, UM will facilitate the formation of an inter-ministerial working group to ensure that results and good practice from this partnership will be incorporated into national policies.Junichi Mori, SfP-Malaysia Chief Technical Advisor, pointed out that currently STEM subjects mainly concentrate on secondary and higher education in Malaysia, when many TVET and skills trainees can benefit from STEM-related generic skills.\u201cIn the changing world of work, STEM skills are necessary for TVET and skills training graduates to land their first job \u2013 a decent job with decent pay \u2013 and then obtain more career progression opportunities, even in a time of uncertainty brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic and the IR 4.0,\u201d said Mr Mori.\u201cFurthermore, many employers require workers with problem-solving skills supported by STEM knowledge for quality and productivity improvement and adoption of new technologies. Therefore, integration of STEM skills will not only improve the relevance of TVET and skills training \u00a0but also \u00a0change the public\u2019s misplaced perception of TVET as second-choice education,\u201d he added.Professor Dato' Ir. Mohd Hamdi Abd Shukor, UM\u2019s Vice-Chancellor, said this partnership will work towards identifying a viable way to integrating STEM in TVET and skills training, while learning from the experiences and success stories of other countries through international comparative analysis.\u201cApart from technical skills, scientific knowledge is essential for operations, troubleshooting and maintenance in smart industry. Thus, equipping future workers with deeper knowledge, higher-order thinking skills and greater adaptability to new technologies in order to secure jobs and remain competitive,\u201d said Dato\u2019 Mohd Hamdi.\u201cWe hope to provide students with skills and knowledge that shape them into effective and competitive individuals in a flattened world. Thus, the future of smart industry will be largely shaped by STEM education,\u201d he added.Kebur Azbaha, Counsellor and Head of Prosperity and Economics at the British High Commission Kuala Lumpur highlighted that promoting STEM education is important for post-COVID economic recovery, contributing to employability, and ultimately higher incomes.\u201cIn the UK we have seen the positive impact of supporting STEM education at an early stage of education. For example, according to the Department of Education in the UK, acceptances into computer science courses have risen by almost 50% from 2011 to 2020; and acceptances to engineering courses are up by 21%,\u201d said Mr Azbaha.\u201cResearch showed that achieving two or more A Levels in STEM subjects adds more than 7.8% to earnings, when compared to just gaining the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) level qualifications (equivalent to the Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia, or the Malaysian Certificate of Education). In addition, recent forecasts have suggested that increasing the number of women working in STEM sectors can increase the UK\u2019s labour value by at least \u00a32 billion. We believe lessons from our experience can be shared with Malaysia, to support more women to benefit from STEM education,\u201d added Mr Azbaha.The ILO-UK-UM partnership is part of SfP-Malaysia\u2019s larger endeavour to improve the quality, inclusiveness, relevance and cost-effectiveness of TVET and skills development systems in Malaysia. SfP-Malaysia is part of the ILO-led Skills for Prosperity in South-East Asia Programme funded by the UK government."

    "title": "DRUG TO TREAT SEVERE CASES OF COVID-19",
    "body": "On 12 January 2020 when the novel coronavirus was first identified as the cause of an outbreak of unexplained pneumonia in Wuhan, China, life carried on as usual for most people. By 9 April 2020, over 1.5 million cases of COVID-19 and more than 80,000 deaths were reported in 184 countries. As we witness the unprecedented speed at which this pandemic has swept across the globe with daily accounts and images of thousands dying, cities becoming ghost towns and healthcare professionals being overwhelmed and themselves stricken by the virus, we ask ourselves if this war can be won.As new information rapidly becomes available and the understanding of COVID-19 grows daily, opportunities to intervene and establish new treatment options are also emerging. The huge global push towards clinical trials has witnessed an exponential rise in the number of studies being approved by health authorities.One such strategy is the use of a medication called tocilizumab (known by its trade name Actemra), a medication used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, in the treatment of severe cases of COVID-19. Several independent clinical trials using tocilizumab have already begun globally with promising results.A study with tocilizumab is scheduled to commence in mid-April 2020 at the University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) together with three Ministry of Health Hospitals; Hospital Sungai Buloh, Hospital Kuala Lumpur and Hospital Tuanku Jaafar, Seremban. The study, led by Prof Dato\u2019 Dr Adeeba Kamarulzaman, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Malaya, and an infectious diseases specialist by training, aims to compare the effectiveness of intravenous tocilizumab versus high dose corticosteroids in approximately 300 patients who develop severe forms of COVID-19.\u201cWe are grateful to Kementerian Kesihatan Malaysia (KKM) for their participation in this very important study that has the potential to save many lives and contribute to the urgent search for the best treatment for patients with COVID-19 especially for those with severe disease,\u201d says Prof. Adeeba.\u201cWe know that approximately 80% of patients with COVID-19 have mild to moderate disease and will recover, however 15% progress to severe disease and another 5% will develop critical illness, with death occurring in between 1-3% of patients.\u201d Prof. Adeeba explains. \u201cWhat is becoming clear is this: in this small group of patients, a dangerous overreaction of their immune system, known as a cytokine storm, overwhelms the patient resulting in respiratory followed by multi-organ failure. So, in these patients, ironically, it is their own immune response to the virus that kills them. And what we need to figure out is how to safely turn off this overactive immune response as soon as it begins,\u201d she adds.When our bodies are attacked by a virus or bacterium, the immune system is triggered to fight the invader. The fight is led by a complex and intricate network of cells, proteins and molecules called cytokines. When the \u201cinvader\u201d or infection has been successfully overcome, the immune system is supposed to shut itself off. But in some cases, instead of shutting off, the immune system continues to release cytokines in an uncontrolled and unregulated manner, resulting in a cytokine storm which can build up and lead to failure of critical organs like the lungs, kidneys and liver.The current understanding of how a patient with COVID-19 progresses is that after the infection, there may be an asymptomatic initial phase that lasts for a few days. When symptoms of fever, cough and tiredness manifest themselves, the virus is already multiplying in the respiratory tract. Mild symptoms can then progress to become a viral pneumonia. For most infected individuals, particularly those who do not have any pre-existing disease or condition, the body will successfully mount a coordinated immune response and recover. We are beginning to have a better understanding of what happens in the approximately 5% of cases who develop severe disease. After about 1 to 2 weeks of the illness, a second phase ensues where the infected individuals will develop signs and symptoms of a cytokine storm that leads to respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.There is growing evidence that interleukin-6 (or IL-6, a specific cytokine) is a critical component of the COVID-19 cytokine storm and that blocking IL-6 may in fact put on the \u201cbrakes\u201d that stops the progression of the disease into its most critical stage. This is where tocilizumab exerts its action.Tocilizumab, a drug specifically designed to block the negative effects of IL-6, has been used for years in the treatment of specific cases of Rheumatoid Arthritis, Giant Cell Arteritis and other conditions where there is excessive inflammation in the body.Clinicians and scientists are increasingly able to identify many patients who are on the brink of developing COVID-19 cytokine storms. Clinicians and researchers at Yale University in the United States where they have been hard hit with COVID-19 cases, have extensive experience using tocilizumab in treating patients. Professors Altice, Price and Malinas from Yale are joining Malaysian researchers in this innovative trial. Professor Altice, also an Academic Icon at Universiti Malaya, has collaborated with Prof Adeeba and her team for over 15 years.This proposed study aims to carefully monitor a group of patients and, as soon as there are clinical and laboratory markers of deterioration, they will be treated with either a high dose of steroids or with tocilizumab. Both are known to inhibit inflammation but do so differently. Tocilizumab targets only the IL-6 receptor while corticosteroids broadly block many aspects of inflammation. The aim of this study is to stop the progression of the hyperinflammation process that leads to respiratory failure. By doing so they hope to prevent as many people as possible from needing to be supported on artificial ventilation that is not only in short supply, but leads to multiple other complications.Our experience using tocilizumab at UMMC with COVID-19 patients who develop the cytokine storm syndrome has been very encouraging. \u00a0 Out of eight patients who were very ill who received tocilizumab, we managed to prevent six from being ventilated. All of these patients are now doing very well. That\u2019s a pretty big deal considering the rate of deterioration described in patients from large centres in China and Italy. In the other two patients, tocilizumab did not work as well as they were already very ill by the time treatment was given. The window of opportunity for response was most probably missed according to Prof. Adeeba.\u201cWhile we are excited about the prospects of tocilizumab preventing COVID-19 deaths, we want to know the ideal time to start the treatment and also to carefully monitor for any side effects among Malaysian patients,\u201d says Dr Suresh Kumar, lead clinician at Sungai Buloh Hospital.The initial funding of RM450,000 to conduct this study was raised from a small group of private donors. \u201cI would like to thank the donors who have contributed generously to make this study a possibility in a relatively short period of time. We hope to raise RM1.5 million for the purpose of this important trial which can help to save lives in our fight against COVID-19,\u201d\u201cWe are also grateful for the donation of tocilizumab by Roche Malaysia that enabled us to treat the first few patients successfully,\u201d said Prof. Adeeba. She estimated that a total of RM1.5 million will be needed for the trial which will be run over a period of 6 months at the 4 hospitals.Those interested to find out more or who would like to make a contribution towards the study, can contact Dato' Prof. Dr. Adeeba Kamarulzaman, Dean of Faculty of Medicine, and Professor of Medicine and Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Malaya, via email to adeeba@ummc.edu.my."

It is worth noting that the treatment of the lake will also be a stepping stone in preserving aquatic life and biodiversity, as maintaining the lake is crucial for the ecosystem.The Environment Quality Act 1974, under the purview of the Department of Environment, stipulates that control measures and continual monitoring programmes must be implemented to\u00a0ensure the quality of water and the circulation of the lake system is enhanced to protect the environment.\u201cIt is heartening to see UEM Sunrise proactively working to ensure the environmental sustainability of its developments. The MoU demonstrates that much can be done in protecting as well as improving Malaysia\u2019s environment through the common effort of all sectors of the nation, including the government, private sector and academia.The preservation, for the public, of the Kepong Metropolitan Park and its Lake is absolutely essential. Moving forward, we hope to see more such collaborations towards making Malaysia\u2019s urban spaces more liveable and towards greater sustainability in the nation as a whole,\u201d said NRECC Minister Nik Nazmi.\u201cWe at UEM Group, firmly believe that preserving the health of the lake serves a dual purpose \u2013 it safeguards our biodiversity and simultaneously paves the way for the sustainable development of Kiara Bay by UEM Sunrise. It underlines our commitment to Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) elements, reinforcing our ongoing efforts to build a better future for both our community and the wider environment,\u201d said UEM Group Managing Director, Dato\u2019 Mohd Izani Ghani.\u201cAs a conscientious developer, we have long recognised the need to balance contributions to the environment, society and economy in all our developments and townships that fulfil communities\u2019 social, physical and spiritual needs. The Kepong Metropolitan Park serves as a communal recreational facility for the public to come together and engage in leisure activities,\u201d said MLMSB Director Sufian Abdullah, who is also Chief Executive Officer of UEM Sunrise.Sufian added: \u201cFor this reason, we want to ensure that it is well-preserved and sustainable by being the first property developer to collaborate with Universiti Malaya on the water assessmentexercise.\u201dUM will compare the analysis results of the lake\u2019s water against the National Lake Water Quality Criteria and Standards (\u201cNLWQS\u201d) by the National Hydraulic Research Institute of Malaysia (\u201cNAHRIM\u201d) and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (\u201cNRE\u201d) (2015) and National Water Quality Standard (\u201cNWQS\u201d). MLMSB\u2019s collaboration with UM also serves as a testament to UEM Sunrise\u2019s Sustainability Blueprint 1.0, anchored by four core pillars: Liveability, Affordability, Sustainability and Resilience. This framework integrates sustainability considerations into every design and development decision the Company makes.Kepong Metropolitan Park is a 234.74-acre (95 hectares) park with a 140.85-acre (57 hectares) lake famously known for its recreational activities. The lake is significant not only to Kiara Bay, as it is UEM Sunrise\u2019s flagship township in Klang Valley through MLMSB, but also to the broader Kepong community, as one of numerous leisure activities hubs."

    "title": "MADAM LAGARDE HIGHLIGHTS CONCOCTION FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE AND ECONOMIC PROSPERITY",
    "body": "On 24 June 2019, Madam Christine Lagarde, Managing Director of International Monetary Fund (IMF), visited Universiti Malaya (UM) and shared her insights during a special engagement session themed \u201cIngredients for Good Governance and Economic Prosperity\u201d. The exclusive event was hosted by UM together with Malaysian Economic Association (MEA) and Talent Corporation Malaysia Berhad.The Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research and Innovation), Professor Dr. Noorsaadah Abd Rahman, gave the welcoming remarks while the President of Malaysian Economic Association, Emeritus Professor Datuk Dr. Norma Mansor, moderated the session.\u201cIMF places strong measures in promoting good governance when providing policy advice, financial support and technical assistance to its member countries. In this process, our Prime Minister, Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad wants Malaysia to re-conduct public affairs and manage public resources by ensuring integrity, impartiality and honesty in the discharge of its sovereign obligations,\u201d said Professor Dr. Noorsaadah Abd Rahman.Madam Lagarde elaborated on Malaysia\u2019s economic achievements and key ingredient for its long term success. For Malaysia to sustain long-term growth, boosting productivity should be the utmost priority. Madam Lagarde highlighted the three key ingredients in driving productivity and they are improving governance and tackling corruption, investing in high quality education and boosting labour force participation for women.The establishment of the National Center for Governance Integrity and Anti-Corruption in 2018 has launched a new anti-corruption plan to eliminate negative entities. The focus is set on making financial transactions more transparent and strengthening oversight capabilities. The progress made has gained IMF\u2019s trust as they eagerly support the efforts in tackling corruption.Malaysia still ranks below the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries\u2019 average in mathematics, science and reading. Madam Lagarde said, \u201cPart of the solution is increased funding for lifelong learning and skills retraining programs.\u201d She also believes that there is a clear path forward for Malaysia to continue its remarkable commitment to improving education.On the labour force participation for women, IMF has set a goal to raise female labour force participation rate by 56% by 2020. Madam Lagarde stated that women tend to be segregated in the workforce which can be recognised by the middling number of career opportunities and the amount of earnings they receive. However, the government has been listening to the collective voices of women when they implemented new laws to protect women\u2019s jobs such as giving maternity leave.All in all, she believes by boosting productivity together with the key ingredients, it will drive the average income growth and raise the living standards in Malaysia, which in turn brings growth to the GDP and overall productivity in the economy.Madam Lagarde\u2019s insightful speech had given the audience an opportunity to further discuss and elicit deeper understanding regarding good governance and economic prosperity.Amongst the distinguished attendees of this occasion were Mrs. Hajah Mahuran Saro Dato' Haji Sariki, Deputy CEO of Talent Corporation Malaysia, Mr. Raja Syamsul Anwar, Director of International Department, Central Bank of Malaysia, Tan Sri Datuk Clifford Herbert, Vice President of MEA and Tan Sri Dato\u2019 Dr. Lin See-Yan, former Deputy Governor of Central Bank of Malaysia."
