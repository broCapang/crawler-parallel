It is a process that involves a combination of multi-disciplinary sets of knowledge and skills ranging from programming to psychology; and from artistic flair to business acumen. The game development process may involve just a single individual or a team of people working for a large development studio.\nGame Development is a fusion of three major disciplines, namely Game Technology, Game Art and Game Design. The industry can also be expanded to a broad umbrella of serious games, educational games and table-top games.\nOur Success Stories, Our Pride in the Computer Games industry.\n \nWan Hazmer - Ex-Lead Game Designer of Final Fantasy XV, Square Enix and Founder, CEO and Game Director at Metronomik Sdn Bhd\nYears before joining SQUARE ENIX Tokyo in 2010, Hazmer was a student in APIIT.

Also remember that during holiday seasons, flights could be expensive or fully booked on your desired dates, so make sure you make your ticket reservation soon after you receive your Student Pass approval letter.\nWhen packing your luggage, remember that there are certain restrictions on the weight of luggage when you travel by air. Excess luggage charges can be quite expensive, so sometimes it may be cheaper to leave your books and heavy things at home and buy new ones in Malaysia.

USD 400 - USD 500) per month depending on the living lifestyle of the students.\nCurrency\nThe local currency is Ringgit Malaysia (RM). It is generally easy to convert currencies at the money changers and banks throughout Malaysia. Most organisations in Malaysia accept major credit cards; some accept travellers' cheques.

Being RATED AS NUMBER 1 IN ASIA AND MALAYSIA for Multicultural Learning Experience (Student Barometer \u00a0Wave 2014) has made APU a truly an International University that makes a world a smaller place!\n11,000++ students that came from more than 110 countries all over the world with proven track record of Employable Graduates \u2013 95%+ Employed by Graduation.\nAll APU programmes are internationally recognized and are benchmarked against International standards plus works with Staffordshire University, UK as partner in quality assurance. Apart from that, APU works in collaboration with partner Universities in UK, Australia, New Zealand, Netherlands, France, USA and Canada whereby Credit transfers are made possible during the course of studies in Malaysia. Hence, what are you waiting for? Come and join us be a part of this thrilling community that can turn into wonders.\nWhat do our European students say about Asia Pacific University (APU)?\n \nI have been born and raised in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, my major concern before arriving in Kuala Lumpur was the culture difference and how I would adjust to a completely different life style, it was a culture shock. Luckily, from the second I arrived in Malaysia, the school\u2019s Student Welcome Team, the administration, especially my counselor has all given me great guidance, and helped me every step of the way. Extra-curricular activities are organized by the school and other student run organizations often, they were a great way for me, to meet and interact with different students from all over the world.\n\u00a0APU\u2019s student body is very diverse. The school organizes a Student Welcome Party for every intake, freshman are able to meet students from the entire intake, there is an annual Multi-Cultural Night where students are able to celebrate their own culture and perform dances, songs, acts etc. on stage with a large audience. All the activities at the school create a great atmosphere around campus while building strong bonds between the student populations.\nThe classes and the studies are challenging; however the lecturers are always there to explain and aid in learning. There are varieties of resources available ranging from online e-databases to personal appointments with lecturers; the lecture slides are available online through Webspace. The lecturers\u2019 usually has a good relationship with the students, and I believe this rapport really helps in the learning process. They also gave a performance for the Multi-Cultural Night mentioned earlier.\u00a0\nI have not regretted choosing Asia Pacific University and my stay in Kuala Lumpur has been unforgettable till so far. I would rate my experience in Kuala Lumpur and Asia Pacific University very positive!\nTommy-Lee Sporkslede\nStudent from Netherlands\nStudying BA (Hons) in International Business Management\n \n\"Since February 2015 I\u2019m taking my master\u2019s course in International Business Communications at Asia Pacific University of Technology and Innovation. The past six months I received a lot of questions about why I chose APU and why Malaysia, as people were very surprised about my decision. However, after my whole life spending in Netherlands it was time to do something totally different and to see the world, plus expand my professional skills internationally. Asia was on top of my list, since it is the opposite of what I am used to and after the traveling I experienced in 2012 around Asia. I immediately knew I wanted to return here. It\u2019s about integrating into a new culture and really getting under the roof of a country, like do things that will take me out of the comfort zone, whether it is food, shopping or a bit of pampering. The great things of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia is that you can find experiences here that can fulfill all your wildest: travel-related, work-related and free time activities. Adding to that, the great weather and the fact that the standard of living is very affordable. Malaysia, especially APU, has many perks like encountering many new cultures here and the easy way you make contact with other expats and students from all over the world. Also I get to experience new things, like events, conferences and trips in my field of interest organized by APU and travel gets a whole new dimension due to dream destinations that are reachable in a heartbeat. Because it is illegal to work under student visa, APU provides on-campus part-time jobs and other extra curriculum activities. Another advantage of studying in APU is the wide range of study resources provided on the Internet and in the library, which means lesser study supplies needed to buy, like books etc. The classes itself are very interactive and assignments that are given are practical and useful. All in all I feel a great pleasure and limitless satisfaction by staying here during my studies and I am even planning to stay here for extra experience after I finish my masters\n.\"\nRebecca Pater\nStudent from Netherlands\nProgramme of Study: MSc in International Business Communications\n \nWhen I graduated from my university in the Netherlands for my Bachelor\u2019s degree I knew I wanted to get a Master\u2019s degree as well.\u00a0 My Dutch university gave students a chance to study for 5 months in a foreign country as a part of the minor programme. I always regretted not taking that opportunity. That is the main reason why I definitely wanted to get my Masters degree abroad.\nI found out about Asia Pacific University via a Dutch agency. I had different choices of universities to go to, however APU\u2019s dual Master degree programmes caught my attention right away. The fact that there is a diploma awarded by APU and one by the University of Staffordshire was a big factor for me to choose this university. \nCurrently I started my first semester of the MBA Euro Asia Business programme. So far I have had only good experiences with the university and Malaysia. An important aspect for me is the industry experience of the lecturers. Most of them have contemporary industry experience because they either still work for a company or are entrepreneurs themselves. Moreover, the topics discussed in class are concerning present-day issues and trends which require the students to be aware and well informed on these topics. \nThe majority of the classes consist of few students, which enables intensive contact between the lecturers and students. The lecturers activate the students to come up with their own ideas on current issues instead of giving a monologue every day. This makes going to classes much more interesting. \nApart from the university, Malaysia is a great place to live. Especially Kuala Lumpur, where people from all over the world live, study and work. This is definitely a big positive aspect for me since I meet people from different cultures every day.\u00a0 Aside from what I learn in the university, the life experience I gain is even worth as much as the degree to me.\u00a0 That is why I would definitely recommend students to study for a Master\u2019s degree at Asia Pacific University.\nTom Sepers\nStudent from Netherlands\nProgramme of Study: MBA (Euro-Asia Business)\nBest time in my life\u2026\nwas during my one year study abroad in Malaysia KL.\nAlone with a half empty language, a bit of fear, happiness, excitement and expectations I landed in November 2013 in KL. My first days didn\u2019t pass, they were so difficult I was in an different environment, I didn\u2019t know anything, no one, not where to go, what to do and worse what to eat, the food was so different then the European. But the weather was absolute great all time sunny. Uni became the only thing in my life, I went there in the morning, evening, and weekend as well. But things changed very, very fast and I found myself in classes with wonderful people around. I made new friends, lovely and helpful, beautiful in their own ways! My housemates made my life easy and colorful. Today as I look back I call them my family coz they thought me that one can have more then one family. My lecturers had an amazing way of teaching us, I was so afraid of failing but I loved to study, to be in classes and get a fair and great education. I learned English, as I had imagined it! APU is a very open minded University everyone is welcome and the staff gives their best to help you with your German bureaucracy. Over there everything is possible \u201ccan laaah\u201d, this is what you learn very first. Malaysia itself is a country of diversity through unity. I learned not only in classrooms, rather much more outside the classroom. I traveled a lot, and I saw wonderful places, swam in the ocean and saved amazing memories, passed the time at great locations. I feed my soul with so much of love. Love of everything. In a nutshell go and live it. I didn\u2019t regret a second. And I still thank everyone who was a part of my awesome trip.\u00a0\nEsra Bodur\nStudent from Germany\nProgramme of Study:\u00a0MSc in International Business Communications\n \nFrom November 2015 until April 2016 I had the pleasure to make my semester abroad at the Asia Pacific University in Kuala Lumpur. At this institute, there are students of more than 120 nations. I\u2019ll never forget the first day of the orientation week. I sat next to students from Mauritius, the Maldives and Malawi. It was the first time ever I met someone not to mention a student from these countries. It was simply amazing, the diversity, the cultures and personalities I met and became friends with.\u00a0\nThe university is very modern, it has a perfect location in the south of Kuala Lumpur, so that it\u2019s not too noisy or crowded but still not far away from the city center. Unfortunately, I didn't get the chance to study at the new campus which is simply overwhelming because it was still under construction during my stay. The lectures and lecturers are competent and patient. It was no problem to tell them to slow down if you didn't catch up. Furthermore, this institute has a bunch of offers for extracurricular activities. From the debate club to the chess club, everything the heart desires is offered. I felt like in one of those American college movies.\n \nThe university offers students accommodations in different price ranges in the area around the university. There are shopping malls, restaurants with delicious Malaysian and international food, cafes etc. It was never boring, especially with my new friends with whom I made several trips at the weekends and midterm break.\nMalaysia is a beautiful country I fell in love with and I can just strongly recommend it to everyone who wants something new, different and multicultural.\nRadas Senadin Martin\nStudent from Germany\nProgramme of Stud\ny:\u00a0\nBachelor in Islamic Banking and Finance\u00a0(Hons)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMore than 11,000 Students from over 110 Countries - Why not YOU?\n \nBe Courageous, Be Visionary. Be Daring. Choose APU.\n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}

{"url": "http://www.apu.edu.my/revival-aral-sea-region-possible-only-through-joint-efforts", "title": "The revival of the Aral Sea region is possible only through joint efforts", "body": " \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nOver the past years, under the leadership of the President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev, comprehensive measures of unprecedented scale and significance have been carried out in the field of solving environmental problems. Measures to solve problems associated with the consequences of the drying up of the Aral Sea are outlined as the most important priorities in this direction.\n \nAll this is gaining great urgency and relevance in the context of global climate change and worsening environmental disasters. Today, there is a growing understanding in the world that the negative changes associated with the Aral Sea catastrophe pose a serious threat not only to the countries of Central Asia\u00a0but also to sustainable development on a global scale.\nAs you know, the area of the dried bottom of the Aral Sea is 4.5 million hectares, including on the territory of Kazakhstan - 2.2 million hectares, Uzbekistan - 2.3 million hectares. Annually, up to 100 million tons of salt dust is removed from the seabed, which is carried over thousands of kilometres, causing irreparable damage to the health of the population, nature and economy of the region.\nIn this regard, fundamental changes were envisaged in approaches to solving the problems of the Aral Sea in the Action Strategy for five priority areas of development of the Republic of Uzbekistan for 2017-2021. In particular, systemic measures were outlined to mitigate the negative consequences of global climate change and the drying up of the Aral Sea for the development of agriculture and human life.\nAlready on 18 January 2017, within the framework of the implementation of these tasks, the State Program for the Development of the Aral Sea Region for 2017-2021 was adopted. In the same year, the Aral Sea Region Development Fund was established to provide reliable and stable financing. An important step in this regard was the implementation of 67 projects worth almost US$800 million, aimed at mitigating the consequences of the disaster, improving the environmental, socio-economic situation and living conditions of the local population.\nA significant event was also holding in 2018 after a ten-year break of the meeting of the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea in Turkmenistan.\nThe meeting discussed issues of improving the fund's activities, improving the environmental situation in the region, coordinated water resources management, strengthening cooperation between Central Asian countries in this direction.\nSpeaking about the need to unite efforts to overcome the negative consequences of the Aral Sea crisis and improve the socio-economic situation in the Aral Sea region, the head of Uzbekistan stressed that IFAS is the only regional organization in this direction, which can become an effective mechanism for interaction between our countries.\nAlso, great attention was paid to the implementation of practical measures for the development of water cooperation in the region, aimed at improving the environmental situation in the Aral Sea region. It was proposed to form a single list and ensure the joint preparation of innovative projects, taking into account the experience of implementing such projects in ecologically unfavourable regions of the world, as well as the allocation of long-term concessional loans and grants for these purposes.\n \nTo this end, in 2018, the Aral Sea International Innovation Center was established under the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan, which is designed to intensify efforts in the field of research, technology transfer and education in conditions of salinity. Scientists have proven that planting such a desert plant as saxaul on the dried bottom will help retain a layer of sand and salt, change the structure of the soil, and restore biodiversity.\nSignificant financial and human resources were allocated to turn the desert into an oasis. And, despite the difficult 2020, which was entirely aimed at combating coronavirus infection, the large-scale greening work that had begun on the dried-up bottom of the Aral Sea did not stop.\nAccording to the latest data, the area of forest plantations on the dried bottom of the Aral Sea has reached 1.2 million hectares.\nAt the same time, it is important to note that control over the execution of decrees and resolutions of the President, aimed at the development of the Aral Sea zone, has been strengthened. For these purposes, in 2020, the Committee for the Development of the Aral Sea Region was created in the Senate of the Oliy Majlis. Under his leadership, active work is underway to implement a number of projects aimed at transforming the zone of ecological crisis into a zone of socio-economic development. For example, in the Takhtakupir region of Karakalpakstan, equipment for purification and desalination of water worth US$1.1 million has been installed. In addition, the committee is negotiating with UNESCO on the inclusion of Karakalpak yurts on the UNESCO Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage, which will undoubtedly be an important step. in the development of tourism and increasing incomes of the population in the Aral Sea region.\nAs you know, the head of state has repeatedly called from the high rostrum the world community to actively consolidate international efforts in order to overcome the consequences caused by the drying up of the sea. Back in 2017, President Sh. Mirziyoyev, speaking from the rostrum of the UN General Assembly, clearly demonstrated the map of the Aral Sea and the scale of its tragedy. Therefore, it is especially important that the initiative of the head of Uzbekistan voiced at this session to create a UN Multi-Partner Trust Fund for Human Security for the Aral Sea region found a lively response in the world community. A year later, on November 27, 2018, the Trust Fund was launched at the UN headquarters in New York.\n \nIn order to widely inform the public about the goals and objectives of the fund, to raise funds for the implementation of the tasks set before it, various events have been organized with the participation of international donor organizations and financial institutions. One of such significant events was the international high-level conference \"Aral Sea - a zone of environmental innovations and technologies\", held on October 24-25, 2019 in Nukus under the auspices of the United Nations. It was attended by representatives of many countries, as well as the UN, World Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Investment Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. At the conference, topical issues were raised related to the need to unite the efforts of the international community aimed at overcoming the consequences of an environmental catastrophe, improving the living conditions of the inhabitants of the Aral Sea region. This forum and other events allowed attracting the necessary investments in a short time and starting the active work of the UN Trust Fund.\nCurrently, the Fund has accumulated funds in the amount of US$26.1 million, of which in 2019 - US$17 million, 2020 - US$9.1 million. another 123.2 million dollars to create new jobs in the region, improve social and natural conditions in the disaster zone.\nThe systematic work of the Fund is intended to contribute to the Advisory Committee on Sustainable Development of the Aral Sea Region created under it on December 1, 2020. It provides valuable guidance on how to develop comprehensive solutions to your challenges. Thus, the committee meeting, held on March 30, 2021, under the auspices of the UN and the Ministry of Investment and Foreign Trade of Uzbekistan, was attended by more than 130 representatives of academia, international financial institutions, UN agencies, NGOs, the private sector, government agencies and representatives of civil society.\nDuring the meeting, it was noted that the fund has currently financed projects in the Aral Sea region to ensure access of the population to drinking water, improve the quality of perinatal care, support innovative youth initiatives in agriculture, improve sanitary conditions in secondary schools and improve the health care system.\nIn particular, it was emphasized that about 35 thousand people in five settlements of the Republic of Karakalpakstan are provided with drinking water, the infrastructure has been significantly improved. In addition, the new equipment has been installed in maternity hospitals in Kungrad and Beruniy districts, as well as in the perinatal centre of Nukus.\nThe meeting also approved new projects worth US$12.4 million. The construction of a multidisciplinary hospital in the Muynak region, the introduction of a number of innovative, resource-saving technologies in agriculture, production and utilities were supported.\nDuring the meeting, development partners - the European Union, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Islamic Development Bank, the United Nations Environment Program, the US Agency for International Development, representatives of a number of countries expressed their readiness to support measures for sustainable development in the Aral Sea region.\nThe work done testifies to the fact that the idea of creating a UN Multi-Partner Trust Fund turned out to be timely and highly demanded. Thanks to this, it became possible to unite international efforts in overcoming the consequences of one of the largest environmental disasters on the planet, when, before the eyes of one generation, the sea actually turned into a desert with an area of 38 thousand square meters. km.\nThe Fund has become an important international platform for the implementation of large-scale and long-term projects aimed at providing practical assistance to the world community to the population of the Aral Sea region.\nAt the same time, the problem under consideration is also in the focus of the leaders of the states of the region. Two consultative meetings (the first in March 2018 in Nur-Sultan, the second in November 2019 in Tashkent), held at the level of the heads of the Central Asian countries, became one of the effective platforms for discussing and solving problems of a regional nature, including environmental ones. The initiator of such meetings was the President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev.\nAs a result of the second meeting of the leaders of the countries of the region, a joint statement was adopted, which, along with other topical issues, covered the problems associated with eliminating the negative consequences of the drying up of the Aral Sea.\nThe document expresses the intention to further develop and strengthen cooperation in the Aral Sea basin. It was also decided to use the capabilities of the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea and the resources of the Multi-Partner Trust Fund to solve practical problems of attracting new knowledge, innovative technologies to the region, comprehensively introducing the principles of a \"green\" economy, preventing further desertification, environmental migration and other measures.\nAn even greater emphasis on this issue was given by the President of Uzbekistan, speaking in September 2020 at the 75th session of the UN General Assembly, where he once again drew the attention of the world community to the continuing destructive impact of the Aral Sea crisis on the entire region. Then the head of state proposed to declare the Aral Sea region a zone of environmental innovations and technologies.\nAll these initiatives and proposals of the head of state, voiced at reputable world platforms, as well as in the course of events of a high regional level, are being consistently embodied in reality.\n \nToday we are not talking about returning the Aral Sea, but at least overcoming its painful consequences for people. To minimize the disaster caused by this large-scale ecological disaster. Man was the cause of the death of the Aral Sea, but it was he who was able to return life to this land. Man-made forests, which rustled at the bottom of the former sea, give hope for this. This land is literally changing before our eyes, people are getting clean drinking water, modern houses, roads, schools and hospitals are being built. Foreign investors come here, the number of tourists from different parts of the world is growing. All this is evidence that the Aral Sea region is being revived and has great prospects.\nNozim Khasanov, \nChief Researcher of ISRS under the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan\n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}

The noise from the ducts is also reduced significantly, improving the acoustic comfort.\nUse of Sustainable Materials\n - The building design is also aimed to provide the occupants with a healthy and productive working environment. The minimal use of ceiling material resource use is reduced via doing away with suspended ceilings, plaster ceiling, ceiling boards except for small areas to conceal the ducts. This reduces the material used as compared to conventional buildings.\nGreen labelled plasterboards are used for the ceiling and the internal partitions. The plasterboards have low volatile organic compound emission and has a percentage of recycled content.\nThe floor carpeting is also green labelled for low VOC emission and has at least 5% recycled content.\nOutdoor Environmental Quality\nLandscaping and an upstand outdoor garden ensure not only a green space but also provide a cool and shaded environment for the occupants. This, coupled with a sperry fabric roof helps to further reduce urban heat.\nBuildings near or surrounded by greenery have lower ambient temperature (surrounding temperature) than the ones away from the greenery and it is seen as an effective way to lower the ambient temperature.\n \n \n \n \n \nOther Initiatives & Campaigns Undertaken\u200b\nFundraising event for Green Peace Malaysia, more than RM 1,000 have been raised.\u00a0\u00a0\nStudents have created a team known as APU Nature\u2019s Musketeers \u2013 they have an insta page where daily facts on environment problems are shared.\u00a0\nStudents have created insta reel challenges \u2013 APU student community are encouraged to recycle items instead of throwing them away.\nTOGETHER\n\u00a0Towards Sustainable Communities\n:\nSustainability @ APU \u2013 click\u00a0\nHERE\nAPU Energy Conservation Program\u00a0\u2013\u00a0click\u00a0\nHERE\nAPU Water Conservation Program\u00a0\u2013\u00a0click\u00a0\nHERE\nAPU Recycling Program\u00a0\u2013\u00a0click\u00a0\nHERE\nAPU Transportation Policy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0click\u00a0\nHERE\nAPU Environment and Climate Change Policy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0click\u00a0\nHERE\nAPU Sustainable Procurement Policy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0click\u00a0\nHERE\nAPU Sustainable Investment Policy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0click\u00a0\nHERE\nAPU Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Policy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0click\u00a0\nHERE\nCorporate Social Responsibility @ APU\u00a0\u2013\u00a0click\u00a0\nHERE\nESG & Sustainability Events \u2013 Activities @ APU\u00a0\u2013\u00a0click\u00a0\nHERE\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}

Students will be able to construct more complex sentence, including expressing ideas and opinions in essay writing using the causative verb.\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\nTestimonials\n \nChen Lik Ken\nMy Korean Language has improved a lot after attending the Korean\u00a0\nlanguage class at APU. The Professor from DSU (Dr. Seo Kyu Won) is a Korean and he is like a talkative and super friendly Uncle. Besides teaching the Korean language programme, he also teaches us a lot about Korea Culture and how local Koreans speak instead of focusing entirely on the textbook. The fee for the programme is also very affordable, especially for APU students.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \nNadja Mary Quimson\nIt has made learning Korean very enjoyable by making it very engaging. Everyone has a chance to practice together during class. Dr Seo is also very patient and kind with us. This course has been by far the most effective to me.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \nDamia Batrisyia Binti Ahmed Faizul - Student who has applied to study in Korea, Dongseo University\nI have learnt a lot within these 6 weeks of classes. The classes were super fun, entertaining and more importantly interactive. It was easy to understand although the teacher is a native Korean speaker. I really enjoyed the speaking and listening activities in class. When everyone is familiar with some Korean phrases, we will just answer the teacher's questions in Korean and it sometimes turned out to be fun! but we learned a lot from it. On top of that, My classmates were really supportive and fun to learn with. Now, I know more about the Korean vocabulary and grammar, and I am able to create a perfect complete sentence! I am truly thankful to get the\u00a0 opportunity to join this Korean Language Programme especially when I am preparing to further my studies in Korea soon.\u2019\u2019\nContact\nFor more information please contact Ms Lee Ai Mun:\nWhatsapp:\n \n\u00a0\nMs Ai Mun\n\u00a0| Tel: 03-89925032 / 6012-3300576 | Email:\u00a0\naimun@apu.edu.my\n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}

Industrial designers focus on the product\u2019s appearance and value on top of how it\u2019s manufactured and user experience. Every product you have and interact in your home is the result of a design process and thousands of decisions aimed at improving your life through design.\nIn professional practice, industrial designers are often part of multidisciplinary teams where everyone works together towards a common goal. This team is made up of strategists, engineers, user interface (UI) designers, project managers, branding experts, graphic designers,customers and manufacturer. The collaboration of so many different perspectives allows the design team to understand a problem to the fullest extent, then craft a solution that skillfully responds to the unique needs of a user.\nIndustrial designers develop the concepts for manufactured products, furniture, such as cars, home appliances, and toys. They combine art, business, and engineering to make products that people use every day. Industrial designers consider the function, aesthetics, production costs, and usability of products when developing new product concept.\nIn the first and second year, student will be exposed to various skills from manual sketching, digital sketching to model making, realising their concept design into reality. Besides that, they will be exposed to various theories and knowledge that are essential in the world of Industrial Design. The student will be able to focus on an area of interest (Product Design/Transport Design/ Furniture Design/ Sustainable Design) determined by their option.\nPROGRAMME\u00a0OUTLINE\nThis programme is specifically designed to provide students with:\nA holistic experience in the field of industrial design.

Students are finding it just as effective as classroom learning. Successful remote & online learning does require some preparation and early awareness. Below are some tips and assistance to ensure that your remote learning experience is effective to your own benefit.\n \n \nBlock out ample time to complete homework assignments, projects and study. Stick to a regular routine and stay organized. You may use a calendaring tool of your choice to schedule routines, classes and deadlines. You may use the calendar within Microsoft Teams or your own digital device, i.e Mobile Phone.\n\u00a0\nMake a daily \"To Do\" list of tasks. You may use task management tools such as Microsoft To-Do. This will help you achieve your daily goals and objectives.\n \nYou will not be able to manage your time if you don\u2019t avoid distractions. That means not watching YouTube, playing a video game, browsing social media sites and social messaging even though your lecturer isn\u2019t there to see you.\n \nCreate your own \u201cclassroom.\u201d\nWhether you have access to a desk in a peaceful room or only a spot at your dining room table, try to replicate the quiet, orderly conditions of an actual on-campus classroom.\nGet some peace and quiet\n.\nYou will need a quiet place to work without distractions from things like television, family, or roommates.\nAvoid games\n.\nConsider uninstalling any computer games to avoid temptation. Or keep the games on a different digital device in your home.\nTurn off your mobile phone\n.\nLet friends and family members know the hours that you will be \"at\" school.\nBeware when surfing the Internet\n.\nIt is easy to lose track of the time as you wander from site to site.\nConsider ergonomics\n.\nAdjust the height of your chair, keyboard, and screen so that you are comfortable. Forearms and thighs should be level and parallel to the floor. Wrists should not be bent while typing.\nSet up good lighting and comfortable seating\n.\nLighting in the room should be at least as bright as the computer screen to avoid eye strain.\n \nDo reach out via preferred APU communications channel (Email & Teams Chat) to your Programme Leaders or Lecturers, if you have a questions about course material, due dates, or any other concerns.\n \nBest way to study is by working in study groups and this can be done via a setup of a conference in Microsoft Teams.\n \nEnsure your Internet connection is stable and fast enough to ensure an uninterrupted learning experience.\n \nOnline & Remote learners need basic technical skills to succeed. These include the ability to create new documents, use a word processing program, navigate the Internet, and download software. Ensure your own computer meets those requirements.\n \nDo take frequent breaks away from your digital device to help ease strains on your eyesight. Do light exercises and physical body movements.\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}

This can only be achieved if all of us exercise strong self-regulation and adopt best practices to prevent infection.\n\u00a0\nAPU COVID-19 Response Team\nLast Updated on: Thursday, 03 November 2022\nMask-wearing now 'highly encouraged' in Malaysia amid rise in COVID-19 cases\nThe Ministry of Health has reported a spike in the number of COVID-19 infections. Just in the last week of October 2022, the number of new infection cases increased by \n16.5%\n to \n16, 917\n cases from \n14, 255\n cases, in the previous week. Given the current situation, the Minister of Health has said that the usage of mask, though voluntary is \nnow \u2018highly recommended\u2019\n.\nAPU\u2019s Guidelines on the wearing of Mask\n1. General University Premises\nWe are always concerned for the wellbeing of the APU community and in line with the Minister\u2019s advice, would encourage all members to generally wear a mask whilst on the university premises.\u00a0\u00a0\n2. Confined Space \u2013 classrooms, laboratories, library elevators etc.\nHowever, in the best interest of all of us at APU, \neveryone must\u00a0 be fully masked always\n whenever in the \nclassrooms, laboratories, library, elevators\n and/or in any areas where social distancing cannot be observed.\nLet us not let our guard down. Let us continue to stay alert and observe all the required safe health practices against COVID-19. Together, we can help contain the spread of COVID-19.\u00a0\nStay safe.\nIMPORTANT : RESUMPTION OF PHYSICAL CLASSES ON CAMPUS\nThe Malaysian Government had recently announced the easing of restrictions for international students arriving into the country as well as new Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the operation of campuses for all students, which came into effect on 1st May 2022. These are in line with the country\u2019s on-going transition from the COVID-19 pandemic towards endemic status.\n\u00a0\nIn light of the above, we are preparing for our next big step \u2013 for teaching and learning activities at APU, APIIT and APLC to revert fully to \nphysical sessions on campus, i.e. back to the \u201cnormal\u201d mode of delivery prior to the pandemic.\n\u00a0\nAs such, we are pleased to announce the following changes in programme delivery mode across all Schools:\n\u00a0\n1.\n \nAny Semester/Intensive English Programme (IEP) Level \ncommencing from 1st September 2022\n onwards \u2013 whether for new or existing students \u2013 will be conducted in physical (face-to-face) mode in the classroom across all levels of study and across all programmes. * As such, the option for Hybrid/Online mode will no longer be available starting from these semesters.\n2.\n \nFor all currently running Semesters/IEP Level and those \ncommencing prior to 1st September 2022\n,\u00a0 we will continue to conduct classes in \nhybrid mode \nuntil the end of the Semester/IEP Level. Students will then attend the \nnext Semester/IEP Level\n face-to-face on campus. However, we would still strongly encourage students to make preparations to attend classes on campus even for the current semester as this will help ease the transition back to face-to-face learning.\n\u00a0\nBased on the above, \nhybrid learning will be phased out for all programmes\n, with the aim of all students attending classes on campus by early 2023.\n\u00a0\n*The exceptions to the above are as follows (as applicable to APU and APIIT students):\nCompulsory MPU (General Studies) modules \nwill continue to be conducted in a combination of online, hybrid and physical sessions.\nPart-Time Master Degrees as well as PhD & DBA Programmes\n will continue to be conducted in hybrid mode until 31st December 2022\nStudents who will be starting their \nFinal semesters at Diploma, Degree or Masters levels\n from 1st September 2022 onwards may also be allowed the option of continuing in hybrid mode.\nFor APU/APIIT students, to find out when your specific APU and APIIT intake and semester will be delivered physically on campus, you may refer to this \nlink\n.\n\u00a0\nWe hope that all students will prepare to return to campus and we look forward to the entire student community being physically on campus over the next few months.\n\u00a0\nFurther announcements will be made regarding SOPs that will be observed while on campus and in classrooms, as and when we receive further guidance from the authorities.\n\u00a0\nPlease do reach out to us at \nbacktocampus@apu.edu.my\n for assistance should you have any queries with regard to your return to campus.\n\u00a0\nRegards,\nAcademic Administration Services\nNew International Students - Updated Arrival Guidelines\nDear Student,\nWelcome to Malaysia and to Asia Pacific University (APU).

While a general summary is provided in the attached infographic, the following SOPs will now apply to all staff and students of APU with immediate effect:-\n\u00a0\n1. MySejahtera Check-in and Check on Vaccination Status\u00a0\nAPU will discontinue the MySejahtera Check-in requirement for all staff and students.\u00a0\nHowever, check-in using our facial recognition system, or by tapping your Student ID will continue for security purposes.\u00a0\nPlease do show our security personnel your MySejahtera status at the entrance, as those who are under Home Surveillance Order or are in the High-Risk category will not be allowed entry.\u00a0\nVisitors and other guests will be required to register their entry into our premises with Security Personnel.\u00a0\n2. Wearing of Masks\u00a0\nThe wearing of masks continues to be mandatory anywhere within the campus buildings, including in classrooms, labs, library, consultation rooms, office spaces and lifts.\u00a0\nPlease do remind your fellow students to observe the above masking requirements at all times.\u00a0\nWhile masks are not mandatory in open spaces, we do encourage you to continue wearing your masks, particularly in crowded areas or where physical distancing is not possible.\u00a0\nPlease be masked at all times should you be in the High-Risk category (i.e. unvaccinated, having recently been in close contact with an infected person, or having health issues that may result in complications if infected)\u00a0\nIf you are unsure, do go ahead and wear a mask for your personal safety and peace of mind.\u00a0\nWhen out in the public, do follow the SOPs stipulated in the Government\u2019s Announcement shown below.\u00a0\n3. Physical distancing\u00a0\nPhysical distancing will no longer be required in all teaching/learning spaces and facilities. (Masks must be worn in these areas)\u00a0\nHowever, in areas where masks are not required, such as in the cafeteria, physical distancing is strongly encouraged, even where it is not mandatory.\u00a0\n4. Hybrid Teaching and Learning\u00a0\u00a0\nTeaching and Learning will continue to be conducted in Hybrid mode on campus until further notice, to cater for students who are still away in their countries/hometowns.\u00a0\nThe number of Hybrid Classes held physically on campus will be increased in the weeks to come and we expect most of your classes to be held on campus from early June 2022 onwards. You are therefore highly encouraged to come to campus to attend your sessions in person together with your classmates, in preparation for all sessions eventually reverting to being fully on campus.\u00a0\n5. If you are tested Positive for COVID-19\u00a0\nIf you are tested positive, please immediately report your status using the MySejahtera App.\u00a0\nQuarantine yourself for 7 days, from the first day of infection.\u00a0\nYou can attend your classes online. If you are medically unable to attend, please do inform your lecturers.\u00a0\nOn the 4th day do a RTK Test supervised by a doctor and if the result is negative you may return to the campus.\u00a0\nIf still infected, do continue to complete the required quarantine period.\u00a0\nOn the 8th day, you can discontinue the quarantine and return to the campus.\u00a0\nThese SOP relaxations should not be a signal for us to let our guard down. The virus is still very much out there, and everyone is in danger of being infected \u2013 even if fully vaccinated or having been infected previously. As such, for your personal safety and that of your family and the APU Community, please do continue to \nwear your mask, sanitise regularly\n and observe all safety SOPs diligently.\nPlease do understand that any non-compliance to SOPs and guidelines anywhere - within the campus or in other locations \u2013 may result in punitive action under Malaysian Law (including fines and cancellation of Student Visas). As such, before you go anywhere, please ensure that you are fully aware of and comply with all applicable instructions and guidelines.\n \nPRECAUTIONARY MEASURES\n(For Parents) What safety measures are in place for our children studying in APU?\nStudents are advised to stay at their accommodation units, practice good personal hygiene and maintain social distancing, and avoid visiting crowded places. In APIIT & APU, comprehensive sanitisation is regularly performed and all precautionary measures are taken to prevent any occurrences of the COVID-19 infection on our campuses.\nStudents are also provided with regular health advisories to remind them to avoid mass gatherings, outdoor activities and to maintain strong personal hygiene at all times.\nWhat happens if there is a case of COVID-19 at APU?\u00a0\nWe have an Emergency Response Team & procedures to handle such a situation. We continue to practice strict sanitisation procedures across the campus facilities to contain infection and to ensure that our student & staff community are adequately protected.\nWhat are the symptoms of COVID-19?\u00a0\nCOVID-19 symptoms can include:\u00a0\nFever\u00a0\nCough\u00a0\nShortness of breath\u00a0\nSore throat\u00a0\nRunny nose\u00a0\nHeadache\u00a0\nMuscle aches\u00a0\nChills\u00a0\nLoss of taste or smell\u00a0\nNausea or vomiting\u00a0\nDiarrhea\u00a0\nIf you have any of these symptoms, stay home and get tested \u2013 even if you are vaccinated.\nDoes fully vaccinated student need to take the RTK-Ag self test on a regular basis?\nThere's no need.

It feels like you are a part of something big and exciting!\nThe best part of it all, is that you are in an international environment where you can see students from different walks of life and they come from different background , education and culture.\nNot only do you get education but also, experiencing and learning other cultures.\nAt APU, you are not here just to get an education only, you are here to create a story for yourself.\nMuhammad Khairul Azzrie Bin Kamaruddin\nBA (Hons) in Information Technology (Business Information Systems)\n \n\u2018I am very grateful to MARA for providing my tertiary education loan in Asia Pacific University for my Bachelor of Science (Hons) Information Technology Specializing in Business Information System. Besides loan for my tuition fees, MARA also provides monthly living allowance which helps to reduce parent's burden during my study years.\nIt was a great experience to study in APU as it has\u00a0 a great mixture of international & local students which promotes different culture and harmony among us as we may group up with international students during classes and assignments.\nKarin Fam\nBSC (Hons) in Software Engineering\n \n\u2018My time in APU was\u00a0 truly international. I entered the Software Engineering degree programme expecting just an education, but I left with lifelong friends from all over the world. The lecturers are experienced and will go the extra mile to help you (if you just reach out to them!) not just in class, but even for extra-curricular activities! Even with the limited facilities and space that we had back in the TPM campus (back in my day we didn't have the much-talked-about new campus), the university and student associations did a great job organizing a plethora of events that are always welcoming for newbies.\nAPU also prepares you for life after uni by organizing many career fairs within the campus itself, where you can even have interviews with recruiters without even leaving the campus grounds. The exposure to the working world within the campus was valuable, and many of my friends and I were recruited before even graduating. I got a great first job experience at Quintiq (now known as Dassault Systemes) thanks to APU, and since then I was fortunate enough to be offered the CTO role at MyBump Media, an adtech startup.\nEmranhelmie Bin Buhari\nB.Eng (Hons) in Mechatronics Engineering\n \n\u2018Mechatronics programme at APU offers a lot of hands-on activities such as manufacturing production (CAD/CAM), group design product and investigation in engineering. All mechatronics engineering students at APU get to put the theory into practice application during the hands-on session.\nThe studies work with the same components, systems, and technology that today\u2019s professionals are working with in the field of mechatronics as well as the hands-on experience truly assist the student to have knowledge about the real industry. Hence, this programme offers student a confidence and experience that needed when come in the real world of engineering industry.\nMechatronics studies in Asia Pacific University are interesting and fun fields that will engage student's minds and knowledge during the four years of study engineering\u2019.\nDownload\nTESP Guidelines\nTESP FAQ\nSTEP Guidelines\nSTEP FAQ\nFor more information please contact us:\nTel: 03-89961000 | Email: \nmara@apu.edu.my\n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}

In fact, I think technology has made the profession more exciting as it has helped remove some of the more repetitive tasks.\n\u201cFor example, the application of robotics in terms of software for the accounts payable function when it comes to tasks like invoice matching, this relieves the workload for the accountant, who can then concentrate on more value-added tasks such as working with vendors on improving the payables process.\u201d\nMalaysian Institute of Accountants\u2019 (MIA) inaugural AccTech Conference,\nInternational Federation of Accountants (IFAC) - President Rachel Grimes\nSource: \nhttps://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/technology-will-easenot-take-over-accounting-jobs-%E2%80%94-ifac\n \n\u00a0\nTECHNOLOGY TRENDS: THEIR IMPACT ON THE GLOBAL ACCOUNTANCY PROFESSION\nAccording to a global survey conducted by Oxford Economics and SAP, 88% of finance executives reported that CFOs in their organisations are becoming more involved in strategic decision-making outside of finance, and 73% of survey respondents agreed that automation is improving the finance function\u2019s efficiency within their organisation. This suggests that organisations are increasingly recognising the importance of utilising technology to improve the efficiency of accounting practices.\n \n \n \nA majority of 88% of participants surveyed stated that CFOs are increasingly taking part in strategic decision-making beyond finance.\nAutomation to drive efficiency is an increasingly critical area for CFOs, with 73% of survey respondents reporting improved efficiency within their organisations.\nCybercrime is a top business risk for finance leaders, with 68% naming it as such in the survey and 76% for the banking industry specifically.\nSource\uff1a\nhttps://mia.org.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MIA_Technology_Blueprint_Spreads_format.pdf\nUNLOCK YOUR POTENTIAL WITH ACCOUNTING TECHNOLOGY\nOur university\u2019s Bachelor of Accounting and Finance (Honours) programme with a specialism in Accounting Technology is designed to give students a competitive edge in the industry by equipping them with the latest trends and technologies in accounting such as AI, blockchain, cloud computing, cybersecurity and data analytics.\nOur programme not only covers basic concepts and theories, but also gives handson experience with tools such as R-programming, Tableau, Power BI, Blockchain Accounting and Robotic Process Automation (RPA).

The recognition is of utmost importance to the engineering education in Malaysia as graduates from accredited engineering degree programmes from Washington Accord signatory countries are considered as meeting the academic standard for practices in engineering at the international level.\nPlease refer too \nhttps://www.ieagreements.org/accords/washington\nThe above benefits are applicable in the following countries, which are signatory to the Washington Accord:\n\u201cSignatories have full rights of participation in the Accord; qualifications accredited or recognised by other signatories are recognised by each signatory as being substantially equivalent to accredited or recognised qualifications within its own jurisdiction\u201d\nhttp://www.ieagreements.org/accords/washington/signatories/\nAustralia\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nEngineers Australia (\n1989\n)\nCanada\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nEngineers Canada (\n1989\n)\nChina\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nChina Association for Science and Technology (2016)\nChinese Taipei\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nInstitute of Engineering Education Taiwan (\n2007\n)\nCosta Rica\n\u00a0-\u00a0Represented by\u00a0\nColegio Federado de Ingenieros y de Arquitectos de Costa Rica (CFIA) (2020)\nHong Kong China\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nThe Hong Kong Institution of Engineers (\n1995\n)\nIndia\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nNational Board of Accreditation\n\u00a0(2014)\n\u00a0(Applies only to programmes accredited by NBA offered by education providers accepted by NBA institutions.)\nIndonesia\n\u00a0-\u00a0Represented by\u00a0\nIndonesian Accreditation Board for Engineering Education (IABEE) (2019)\nIreland\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nEngineers Ireland (\n1989\n)\nJapan\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nJapan Accreditation Board for Engineering Education (\n2005\n)\nKorea\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nAccreditation Board for Engineering Education of Korea (\n2007\n)\nMalaysia\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nBoard of Engineers Malaysia (\n2009\n)\nMexico\n\u00a0-\u00a0Represented by\u00a0\nConsejo de Acreditaci\u00f3n de la Ense\u00f1anza de la Ingenier\u00eda (CACEI) (2016)\nNew Zealand\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nInstitution of Professional Engineers NZ (\n1989\n)\nPakistan\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nPakistan Engineering Council\u00a0\n(2017)\nPeru\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nInstituto de Calidad Y Acreditacion de Programas de Computacion, Ingeneria Y Technologia (ICACIT)\n\u00a0(2018)\nRussia\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nAssociation for Engineering Education of Russia (\n2012\n)\nSingapore\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nInstitution of Engineers Singapore (\n2006\n)\nSouth Africa\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nEngineering Council of South Africa (\n1999\n)\nSri Lanka\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nInstitution of Engineers Sri Lanka\n\u00a0(2014)\nTurkey\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nMUDEK (\n2011\n)\nUnited Kingdom\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nEngineering Council UK (\n1989\n)\nUnited States\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nAccreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (\n1989\n)\n\u201cOrganisations holding provisional status have been identified as having qualification accreditation or recognition procedures that are potentially suitable for the purposes of the Accord; those organisations are further developing those procedures with the goal of achieving signatory status in due course; qualifications accredited or recognised by organisations holding provisional status are not recognised by the signatories\u201d\n\u00a0\nhttp://www.ieagreements.org/accords/washington/signatories\nBangladesh\n\u00a0\n-\u00a0Represented by\u00a0\nThe Institution of Engineers Bangladesh (IEB)\nChile\n\u00a0\n-\u00a0Represented by\u00a0\nAgencia Acreditadora Colegio De Ingenieros De Chile S A (ACREDITA CI)\nPhilippines\n\u00a0-\u00a0Represented by\u00a0\nPhilippine Technological Council (PTC)\u200b\nThailand\n\u00a0-\u00a0\nRepresented by\u00a0\nCouncil of Engineers Thailand (COET)\nMyanmar\n\u00a0-\u00a0\nRepresented by\u00a0\nMyanmar Engineering Council (MEngC)\nSaudi Arabia\n\u00a0-\u00a0Represented by \nEducation and Training Evaluation Commission (ETEC)\nNigeria \n-\u00a0\nRepresented by\u00a0\nCouncil for the Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria (COREN)\nEngineering Programmes\nBachelor of Engineering in Electrical & Electronic Engineering with Honours\nBachelor of Mechatronic Engineering with Honours\nBachelor of Mechanical\u00a0Engineering with Honours\nBachelor of Computer\u00a0Engineering with Honours\nBachelor of Petroleum Engineering with Honours\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}

Psychology looks at the person, the mind, thoughts, emotions and behaviour using scientific methods. As our society continues to progress with technology, it is evident that a large percentage of our lives are online - how technology influences our thoughts and behavior, and ultimately how it shapes us as individuals and as a society are key focus areas for human behaviour experts today.\nAs the modern society places more emphasis on mental health and psychological wellbeing, there is no better time for you to consider a career in psychology. You can explore careers in education, social services, human resources, training & consultancy, social science researcher, counterintelligence analyst, social media threat analyst etc.\nAs a graduate of the APU Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Psychology programme or the APU/DMU dual award Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Psychology programme, you will be equipped with knowledge from technology-infused psychology modules such as cyberpsychology, which is a scientific inter-disciplinary domain that focuses on the psychological phenomena which emerge because of human interaction with digital technology. Because here at APU we believe that in this digital era, a career in human mental health will require both the human touch like structuring of mental health assessments as well as technological know-how, using modern technology tools for psychology assessments and analysis. This will offer you a stronger edge in the modern and technology-driven world, in addition to the more conventional psychology teaching.\nThe Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Psychology programme is specifically designed to provide a solid understanding of psychology and its concepts in the contemporary environment for students to be able to articulate what they have learned as a human scientist. This three-year undergraduate programme will provide a clear understanding of the human mind, behaviour, and different types of personalities. This programme is offered as a Dual degree programme in partnership with De Montfort University (DMU) and is recognised both locally and internationally.\nPSYCHOLOGY FOR A DIGITAL WORLD\nDigital Mental Health Tools\n \nSocial media is about sociology and psychology, more than technology\n- \nBrian Solis\nScience and technology multiply around us. To an increasing extent they dictate the languages in which we speak and think. Either we use those languages, or we remain mute.\n- \nJ.G. Ballard\n \nBREAKING THE PSYCHOLOGY BARRIER\n\u201cEmployment for all psychologists is expected to grow by 14% in the decade from 2016-2026, which is faster than average. \u201d\n- \nBureau of Labor Statistics, US\n\"Insufficient number of psychologists in Malaysia.

If someone needs to see a mental health professional, the waiting period can be between eight months and a year.\u201d\n- \nDr Nur Anuar Abdul Muthalib, 2017, \nVice President of Yayasan Hasanah\nWHAT IS DISTINCTIVE ABOUT THIS PROGRAMME?\nThe psychology programme at APU is designed to produce graduates who are ready for a career in the fields of psychology, with the added advantage of having specialized knowledge to accurately identify and utilize technology to aid the field of mental health and enable enhanced understanding of human behaviour. Students learn about how psychology is evolving through practical and theoretical understanding of human behaviour and mental health. The Psychology Centre is also equipped with high tech equipment and software that students have the advantage of using in practical lab sessions.\n \nCENTRE FOR PSYCHOLOGY AND WELL-BEING AT APU\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u200b\nIn Malaysia, mental disorders estimated to be responsible for about 8.6% of total DALYs.

A high demand of CGI has made visual effects more accessible and hence its presence is felt all around us.\nThe VFX award is for applicants looking for a career in the film, post-production or games industries - although some graduates may move onto positions within archi- tectural visualisation, re-touching/ advertising agencies or postgraduate study. VFX is predominantly about ideas and concept generation for film or games, covering characters, vehicles, products, clothing, sets and environments - ultimately taking those ideas through to finished concept artwork or 3D models.\nMore than ever, the film and games industries need tangible, exciting plots/scenarios with characters, environments and props to match them. Students develop ideas sometimes as 2D artwork concepts, complemented by accurate 3D digital modelling, coupled with green screen/compositing techniques. Design methodology, concept origination, speculative design, visualisation skills, life drawing, physical sketch and facsimile modelling provide traditional design skills.\nPROGRAMME OUTLINE\nThis programme is specifically designed to provide students with:\nThe knowledge and skills to support the study and development of conceptual artwork, digital assets for both film or games industries and visual effects (VFX) work as a creative and dynamic activity.\u00a0\nTo develop the organisational qualities, communication skills necessary for the effective exchange of ideas, information and teamwork; with particular emphasis on understanding production \u2018pipelines\u2019 associated with VFX industries.\nDEGREE LEVEL 1\nLevel 1 of VFX will focus on getting the basics right. The students will be exposed to drawing and concept sketching techniques, creative thinking for visual design, understanding the importance of research and analysis in conceiving a concept. Technically they will be introduced to the VFX workflow via Digital Art and Illustration, 3D Modelling and Compositing Techniques. Team Work, Project Management and Presentation is an integral part of the learning process.\u00a0\nCORE MODULES\nCinema Film Analysis\nIllustration for Concept Art\n3D Pipeline\nCreative Project\nFundamentals of Entrepreneurship\nAdvance 3D Pipeline\nDigital Compositing\nDigital Illustration\nMotion Graphics\nDEGREE LEVEL 2\nIn Level 2, the modules strengthen the core skills of the students. Moving on from Year 1 the students are trained to emphasis on critical thinking and problem solving skills. They are exposed to advanced 3D Modelling and Compositing skills on software\u2019s that are currently used by the VFX Industry. The students have the choice of selecting their elective module to strengthen their skills in their field of choice.\nCORE MODULES\nCharacter Creation\nAnimation Techniques for Games\nAdvanced Digital Compositing\nDigital Film Production\nSet Design\nEffects and Simulation\nELECTIVE MODULES\nCGI Production\nDigital Sculpting\nVisual Culture\nProduction Planning and Management\nINTERNSHIP (16 WEEKS)\nStudents will undertake a short Internship/ Industrial Training for a minimum period of 16 weeks to prepare them for a smooth transition from the classroom to the working environment.\nDEGREE LEVEL 3\nIn Level 3 the students will be implementing their prior knowledge and skills to create professional portfolio projects as part of the final year projects. From Proposal Pitch, Pre Production, Production and Post Production the students go through the entire process to create their FYP with constant guidance from experts and industry professionals.

\u2013 APU\n \n \nHello! My name is Aidinai Chinbaeva. I am student from Kyrgyzstan in APU. I am doing Bachelors in Accounting and Finance (2nd level, General).\u00a0Why I am choosing APU?\nIt provides a great opportunity to network globally since 60 % of the students originate from different parts of the world.\nIt\u2019s located strategically, 10-15 min by car to the capital city or 30 min by train.\nLectures and tutorials are structured in such a way to make you think out of the box.\nIt creates a platform for students to interact with each other and learn about diverse cultures through the cultural nights hosted seasonally at the university\u2019s premises.\nApart from having a good reputation of employable graduates, APU ensures that you practice your skills even before graduating though internships or giving opportunities forstudents to work within the university, as student helper/ ambassadors /library assistants.\nThere is also the provision of one to grow through extra-curricular activities such as the various clubs and sports available.\nI am glad to be part of APU big family.\nThis university gives a lot opportunity to be successful person in future.\n\u0418\u043c\u044f: \nAIDINAI CHYNYBAEVA\n\u0421\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430: \nKyrgyzstan (Karakol)\n\u041d\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u044b: \n(Accounting and finance).\n \nMy name is Aisuluu Kasymova and I am from Kyrgyzstan.\nAs a student of Asia Pacific University of Technology and Innovation I have been staying in Malaysia for the past 2.5 years pursuing the degree in Software Engineering. As for foreign student it was difficult to stay in another country far from my family and friends in a totally different environment, however, APU with its diversity of people from various countries all around the world became a new experience for me.\nAPU gives a lot of opportunities for students to express themselves in different extracurricular activities, various events are organized by students where people can get to know traditions and customs of other nations and experience different cultures. Moreover, APU is the only university that provides part-time job opportunities for students which was very important for me since as well as other students I wanted to support my parents at least by paying for pocket expenses. After I became Technical Assistant I was able to do so, plus, I gained invaluable technical experience and learned how to better manage my time and behave in work environment. As an IT student I was glad to discover plenty of technical workshops, seminars, competitions, and certification courses organized for software students by such companies as Microsoft, Google, IBM, CISCO, and more.\nIn overall, experience that I gained here will be definitely useful in my future and apparently I will miss these years spent in APU and Malaysia generally.\n\u0418\u043c\u044f:\n AISULUU KASYMOVA\n\u0421\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430: \nKYRGYZSTAN (BISHKEK)\n\u041d\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u044b:\n (SOFTWARE ENGINEERING)\n \nMy name is Azizkhon Maksumov and I am from Uzbekistan.\u00a0I did my degree in Malaysia at APU from 2010 till 2013 and those years were the best ones in my entire life.\u00a0\nI made a lot of friends from all over the world with different cultures and nationalities. I have learnt a lot about the all the subjects that we had.\u00a0\nThe lecturers and all the staff that work at the administration were great. They helped me in every aspect of my spending time in Malaysia and I am still really grateful.

Little did I know that the stairs I was climbing will only take me higher and I\u2019ll never have to look down from there. A.P.U had been a journey that changed my life for good in every aspect - from my career perspective to my personality. Through tutorials and assignments with incredibly supportive classmates from a diverse culture, added with the latest technologies and professors who were nothing short of champions, I was challenged to discover a part of me I didn\u2019t know I had. That part now plays a central role in my work, as a Content Developer and News Presenter in Channel 8 News Bangladesh, a business alliance of a multinational company Digital Media Express, that also happens to be a Google partner. It is vital to think critically, to plan, to imagine, to communicate, and to engage with foreign clients and journalists - all of which, my years in A.P.U has embedded deep within me. Having been shaped by A.P.U in a creative, fun, yet rigorous, environment, I found myself able to communicate, innovate, and collaborate in ways that enabled me to build a successful career in Digital Media Express.\nReflecting upon my four years, i.e. Foundation plus my Dual Degrees in BA (Hons) International Business Management, I conclude that the four years at A.P.U were undoubtedly among the best years of my life - so much so that, A.P.U members now feel like family I\u2019ve left behind and Malaysia feel more like home to me than my own country.\nMehnaz Habib\nGraduated with Second Class First Division Honours\nBA (Hons)\u00a0in International Business Management\n \nJoining Asia Pacific University has been an ultimate turn over of my life. It is one of the best renowned private university in Malaysia who has gained tremendous reputation in the education sector of Malaysia.

Because of the great effort from the lecturers and the staffs, I have successfully achieved 2nd class 1st Hons in Software Engineering. Furthermore, being an international student, it is a great atmosphere in APU as students can see diversified cultures along with a friendly and helping mindset. Altogether, it has really helped me to achieve success in life and has combined self-confidence, passion and dedication towards my future life.\nZebel al Tareq\nGraduated with Second Class First Division Honours\nB.Sc (Hons) in Software Engineering\nI have received my SSC / O-Level\u00a0and\u00a0HSC / A-Level results.

Development of a CV\n2. Attending Interviews\n3. Working professionally and ethically at a organization\nAPU also has dedicated Internship Officers per school and a company pool bank in which student can choose from in terms of writing in or direct placements.\n \nProgramme Educational Objectives (PEOs)\nPEO\nElectrical and Electronic\nEngineering (EEE)\u00a0\nMechatronic Engineering (ME)\nMechanical Engineering (ME)\nComputer Engineering (CE)\nPetroleum Engineering (PE)\nPEO1\nBe a practicing engineer contributing to the development of Electrical or Electronic Engineering while demonstrating professionalism.\nBe a practicing engineer contributing to the development of Mechatronic Engineering while demonstrating professionalism.\nBe a practicing\nengineer\ncontributing to the\ndevelopment of\nMechanical\nEngineering while\ndemonstrating\nprofessionalism\nBe a practicing engineer contributing to the development of Computer or Electronic Engineering while demonstrating professionalism.\nBe a practicing engineer contributing to the development of Petroleum Engineering while demonstrating professionalism.\nPEO2\nPursue engineering innovation via career advancement opportunities and/or advanced studies in Electrical or Electronic Engineering.\nPursue engineering innovation via career advancement opportunities and/or advanced studies in Mechatronic Engineering.\nPursue engineering\ninnovation via\ncareer\nadvancement\nopportunities\nand/or advanced\nstudies in\nMechanical\nEngineering.\nPursue engineering innovation via career advancement opportunities and/or advanced studies in Computer or Electronic\u00a0 Engineering.\nPursue engineering innovation via career advancement opportunities and/or advanced studies in Petroleum Engineering.\nProgramme Learning Outcomes (PLO)\nThe students, upon completion of their study, should attain the following outcomes:\nS.No\nPO#\u00a0\nAPU-School of Engineering PO's\n1\nPLO1\nAbility to gain and apply principles of Mathematics, Science and Engineering to the solutions of complex engineering problems.\n2\nPLO2\nAbility to undertake complex engineering problem analysis and apply engineering principles to solve them.\n3\nPLO3\nAbility to design innovative solutions for complex engineering problems.\n4\nPLO4\nAbility to investigate complex engineering problems using research techniques.\n5\nPLO5\nAbility to select and use suitable tools and techniques for complex engineering problems.\n6\nPLO6\nAbility to engage in professional engineering practice for safety, health, social, cultural and legal responsibilities in developing solutions for complex engineering problems.\n7\nPLO7\nAbility to comprehend and demonstrate good practices of engineering in sustainable development and environmental considerations for the solutions of complex engineering problems.\n8\nPLO8\nAbility to execute the responsibilities of an Engineer professionally and ethically.\n9\nPLO9\nAbility to function effectively as a team leader or a member in a team within multi-disciplinary settings.\n10\nPLO10\nAbility to communicate effectively and professionally on complex engineering activities.\n11\nPLO11\nAbility to demonstrate entrepreneurship skills, engineering project management and economic decision making in multidisciplinary environments.\n12\nPLO12\nAbility to recognise the need for, and be able to engage in independent and life-long learning towards continuous professional development.\nOutcome Based Education (OBE)\nOur curriculum is a collaborative effort, between our team of academicians and our Industry Advisory Panel (IAP). We design our curriculum based on the needs of the industry, to ensure Employability Edge among our students, while maintaining our standards, by ensuring our programmes are full-accreditation compliant.\u00a0\nOur curriculum allows students to own their own future through the deployment of a robust yet turgid curriculum that allows students to expand their horizon into other fraternities (minors) or to deep dive within the engineering fraternity (extensions).\nOur programme delivery is based on Outcome Based Education (OBE), in which high graduate employability is our end result.\nValue-added Skills Training\nApart from technical knowledge in the Engineering field, we highly believe that students should also possess life skills such as critical thinking, communication and professionalism. Our Problem Based Learning (PBL) leads to producing critical and innovative graduates, in which multiple wins in various industry-standard-competitions are our best testaments of success.\nStudent Experiences \nOur academicians believe that learning should not be confined within classrooms and lecture halls. As early as the first year of their study, students possess the opportunities to gain hands-on exposure to the industry, to experience life as a professional engineer, as well as to build connections with professional engineers through regular industrial visits to manufacturing plants, factories, sites and offices of our industry partners, such as MEASAT, Top Glove, ABB and more.\nThe IEM-APU Student Section (IASS) is a committee for the students by the students. Since its establishment in 2015, IASS never failed to organise monthly technical events in collaboration with IEM, to boost students\u2019 managerial skills, innovation and presentation skills while learning to manage and organise professional-standard events from A to Z.\nINTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION \u2013 ENGINEERING DEGREES ACCREDITED UNDER THE WASHINGTON ACCORD\n \nAPU Engineering Degrees are fully accredited by the \nBoard of Engineers Malaysia (BEM)\n which is a signatory to the Washington Accord.\nAPU Engineering Degrees are Accredited Professionally by the Board of Engineers Malaysia (BEM) and are therefore recognised internationally under the Washington Accord. Recognition under the Washington Accord allows for APU engineering programmes to be recognised by countries such as Australia, Canada, China, Chinese Taipei, Costa Rica, Hong Kong China, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Pakistan, Peru, Russia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States who are all signatories of the accord.\nThis allows APU graduates to be recognised in these countries for career opportunities towards achieving Professional/Chartered Engineer status or for further education progression. Furthermore, many countries which are not yet signatories to the Washington Accord also use this as a benchmark in recognising Engineering Degrees.\nThis accreditation ensures that APU Engineering Graduates will have the following benefits in countries who are signatories of the Washington Accord:\nOpportunities to register as a Graduate Engineer with Board of Engineers Malaysia (BEM) or the relevant professional bodies in other countries who are signatories under the Washington Accord.\nPathways to becoming a Professional or Chartered Engineer.\nAssurance that graduates are considered as having met international academic standards for engineering practice.\nWith this achievement, recognition under the Washington Accord enables APU Engineering graduates to work in any country in the world who are also a signatory to the Accord, without the need to re-qualify. The recognition is of utmost importance to the engineering education in Malaysia as graduates from accredited engineering degree programmes from Washington Accord signatory countries are considered as meeting the academic standard for practices in engineering at the international level.\nPlease refer to\u00a0\nhttps://www.ieagreements.org/accords/washington/\nThe above benefits are applicable in the following countries, which are signatory to the Washington Accord:\n\u201cSignatories have full rights of participation in the Accord; qualifications accredited or recognised by other signatories are recognised by each signatory as being substantially equivalent to accredited or recognised qualifications within its own jurisdiction\u201d\nhttp://www.ieagreements.org/accords/ washington/ signatories/\nAustralia\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nEngineers Australia (\n1989\n)\nCanada\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nEngineers Canada (\n1989\n)\nChina\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nChina Association for Science and Technology (\n2016\n)\nChinese Taipei\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nInstitute of Engineering Education Taiwan (\n2007\n)\nCosta Rica\n\u00a0-\u00a0Represented by\u00a0\nColegio Federado de Ingenieros y de Arquitectos de Costa Rica (CFIA) (\n2020\n)\nHong Kong China\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nThe Hong Kong Institution of Engineers (\n1995\n)\nIndia\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nNational Board of Accreditation\n\u00a0(2014)\n\u00a0(Applies only to programmes accredited by NBA offered by education providers accepted by NBA institutions.)\nIndonesia\n - Represented by\u00a0\nIndonesian Accreditation Board for Engineering Education (IABEE) \n(2019)\nIreland\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nEngineers Ireland (\n1989\n)\nJapan\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nJapan Accreditation Board for Engineering Education (\n2005\n)\nKorea\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nAccreditation Board for Engineering Education of Korea (\n2007\n)\nMalaysia\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nBoard of Engineers Malaysia (\n2009\n)\nMexico\n\u00a0-\u00a0Represented by\u00a0\nConsejo de Acreditaci\u00f3n de la Ense\u00f1anza de la Ingenier\u00eda (CACEI) 2016\nNew Zealand\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nInstitution of Professional Engineers NZ (\n1989\n)\nPakistan\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nPakistan Engineering Council\u00a0\n(2017)\nPeru\n\u00a0- Represented by \nInstituto de Calidad Y Acreditacion de Programas de Computacion, Ingeneria Y Technologia (ICACIT)\n\u00a0(2018)\nRussia\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nAssociation for Engineering Education of Russia (\n2012\n)\nSingapore\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nInstitution of Engineers Singapore (\n2006\n)\nSouth Africa\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nEngineering Council of South Africa (\n1999\n)\nSri Lanka\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nInstitution of Engineers Sri Lanka\n\u00a0(2014)\nTurkey\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nMUDEK (\n2011\n)\nUnited Kingdom\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nEngineering Council UK (\n1989\n)\nUnited States\n\u00a0- Represented by\u00a0\nAccreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (\n1989\n)\n\u201cOrganisations holding provisional status have been identified as having qualification accreditation or recognition procedures that are potentially suitable for the purposes of the Accord; those organisations are further developing those procedures with the goal of achieving signatory status in due course; qualifications accredited or recognised by organisations holding provisional status are not recognised by the signatories\u201d\nhttp://www.ieagreements.org/accords/washington/signatories\nBangladesh\n\u00a0-\u00a0Represented by \nThe Institution of Engineers Bangladesh (IEB)\nChile\n\u00a0-\u00a0Represented by \nAgencia Acreditadora Colegio De Ingenieros De Chile S A (ACREDITA CI)\nMyanmar\n\u00a0-\u00a0Represented by\u00a0\nMyanmar Engineering Council (MEngC)\nNigeria\n - Represented by \nCouncil for the Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria (COREN)\n\u00a0\nPhilippines\n\u00a0-\u00a0Represented by \nPhilippine Technological Council (PTC)\u200b\nThailand\n\u00a0-\u00a0Represented by \nCouncil of Engineers Thailand (COET)\nSaudi Arabia\n - Represented by \nEducation and Training Evaluation Commission (ETEC)\nYour Study Progression\n \nEngineering Programmes\nBachelor of Electrical and Electronic Engineering with Honours\nBachelor of\u00a0Mechatronic Engineering with Honours\nBachelor of Mechanical Engineering with Honours\nBachelor of Computer\u00a0Engineering with Honours\nBachelor of Petroleum Engineering with Honours\nUndergraduate\u00a0Study Areas:\nComputing,\u00a0Technology & Games Development\nDesign, Advertising & Animation\nBusiness, Management, Marketing & Tourism\nAccounting, Banking,\u00a0Finance and Actuarial\nMedia, International Relations & Psychology\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}

If you already have your accommodation arranged, you are advised to arrive in KL at least a few days before your course starts, so that you can settle down with your accommodation and the new environment. Also remember that during holiday seasons, flights could be expensive or fully booked on your desired dates, so make sure you make your ticket reservation soon after you receive your Student Pass approval letter.\nWhen packing your luggage, remember that there are certain restrictions on the weight of luggage when you travel by air. Excess luggage charges can be quite expensive, so sometimes it may be cheaper to leave your books and heavy things at home and buy new ones in Malaysia. Check with your travel agent or airline on how much you can bring, what you are allowed and not allowed to bring into Malaysia.\nWhat Kind of Clothing Should I Bring?\nIt averages 29 degrees Celsius year round in Malaysia, so leave your sweaters and winter coats at home! You will need both professional attire and casual. During school session, professional attire is required on campus. You may want to bring casual clothing for non-school and off-campus events.\nWhat should I bring with me?\nMake yourself feel at home! Bring personal stuff like posters or photographs of your friends and family. If you are bringing any electrical equipment with you, remember that the power supply in Malaysia is 220 - 240 volts / 50 cycle AC system.\n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}

Following this, Bipolar went to North America and was on the University of British Columbia (UBC) collegiate roster which is no small feat considering that UBC had proven they were the best collegiate level team in the world just the previous year. In his first year at UBC, Bipolar assisted UBC to their second North American collegiate championship in a row netting him a full scholarship from Riot Games for his first year at UBC.
